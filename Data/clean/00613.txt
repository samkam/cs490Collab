what

about

have

they

we
also
embrac
abba
becaus
of
the
subtleti
inher

and
the
impli
sad
therein
abba
have
becom
the
ultim
pop

in

intertextu

as
we
as
listen
interpret
what
abba
ha
to
offer
through
the
entir
histori
of

music
and
filter
it
into
their
magnific
essentialist
mode
of

some
peopl
balk
at
abba
reduc
their
music
to
confect

commod
but
i
think
that
s
miss
the
point
i
m
not
sure
abba
ever
set
out
to
be
as
huge
as
they
were
are
i
just
think
that
benni
björn
agnetha
and
anni

to
take
all
the
lesson
that
pop

had
taught
them
and
repeat

the

from

have
a
special

in
my

mayb
abba

legaci
now
