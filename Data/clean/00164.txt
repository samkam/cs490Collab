go
to
believ
that
the
best
doe
it

further
on
ana
s
take
i
had
never
heard
of
ann
of
green
gabl
until
a
coupl
of
year
ago
as
far
as
i
know
it
wa
never
a
big
titl
in
brazil
wikipedia
tell
me
of
two
translat
one
publish
in
1956
and
out
of
print
and
one
publish
in
2009
when
i
had
alreadi
move
away
as
such
ann
of
green
gabl
ha
not
been
a
part
of
my
childhood
not
even
as
part
of
a
collect
cultur
knowledg
no
my
import
childhood
friend
were
pollyanna
and
the
littl
princ
never
ann
shirley
but
allow
me
to
retrac
my
step
to
the
moment
i
start
read
thi
book
becaus
my
first
impress
wa
not
one
of
enthusiasm
as
an
adult
read
from
a
modern
perspect
in
thi
distant
21st
centuri
there
wa
a
bit
of
cultur
shock
and
discomfort
allow
me
to
remind
you
that
marilla
and
andrew
want
an
orphan
kid
not
out
of
kind
but
becaus
they
want
a
child
worker
ye
they
sent
for
a
boy
of
11
eleven
so
that
the
boy
could
work
in
return
of
room
and
board
let
that
sink
in
there
is
a
bit
of
xenophobia
and
surpris
racism
in
the
book
at
one
point
street
urchin
are
call
london
street
arab
and
ann
is
con
by
peddler
who
wa
a
german
jew
and
not
one
of
those
italian
like
marilla
thought
it
is
possibl
to
be
a
fan
of
problemat
thing
there
is
also
the
question
of
my
harden
cynic
heart
when
face
with
the
type
of
charact
that
ann
is
the
unbear
sweet
extrem
quirki
ever

of

and
freckl
i
confess
it
wa
hard
to
start
with

so
i
ve
never
read
thi
book
but
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
1979
anim
seri
base
on
it
call
akag
no
ann
which
is
appar
somewhat
highli
regard
in
japan
the
founder
of
studio
ghibli
work
on
it
i
wasn
t
sure
how
faith
it
wa
to
the
sourc
materi
i
know
a
lot
wa
ad
to
fill
out
a
50
episod
run
but
read
thi
post
i
m
recogn
all
of
the
scene
discuss
and
even
a
lot
of
the
dialogu
seem
to
be
ident
i
don
t
think
the
seri
wa
ever
offici
releas
in
english
appar
it
wa
fairli
big
in
non
anglophon
europ
but
if
you
don
t
mind
resort
to
fansub
there
are
way
to
track
it
down
it
s
obvious
date
the
anim
can
be
fairli
janki
at
time
and
it
s
extrem
slow
pace
but
it
s
got
some
gorgeou
background
art
and
a
beauti
score
i
ve
kind
of
fallen
in
love
with
it
no
ann
drew
a
long
breath
i
thought
you
like
me
of
cours
but
i
never
hope
you
love
me
i
rememb
watch
thi
scene
and
think
you
could
easili
interpret
ann
s
relationship
with
dianna
as
be
romant
in
the
modern
sens
without
realli
chang
anyth
then
again
mayb
i

i
encount
thi

a
veri

and
help
a
teacher
clean
out
her
classroom
book
she
said
i
could
have
it
and
i
hid
it
under
my
t
shirt
bulki
old
hardback
that
it
wa
and
squirrel
it
away
in
my
room
and
read
it
and
then
reread
it
and
reread
it
again
and
again
and
again
becaus
our
famili
didn
t
have
money
for
book
that
weren
t
religi
book
and
becaus
even
my
librari
book
had
to

seri
i
wrote
so
much
fanfict
on
thi
seri
it

not
funni
i
m
go
to
go
ahead
and
admit
that
her
sequel
are
probabl
better
than

it
s
funni
to
think
with
horror
of
the
xenophob
stuff
i
rememb
it
but
it
wa

for
the
cours
for
marilla
