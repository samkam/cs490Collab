what
you
have
miss
in
the
rule
of
the
totem
though
is
that
you
don
t
share
your
totem
with
anybodi
in
the
real
world
in
a
dream
it
doesn
t
matter
becaus
the
totem
owner
is
still
the
onli
person
to
know
the
actual
weight
and
feel
of
the
totem
and
how
it
act
in
the
real
world
so
it
is
okay
to
share
a
totem
if
you
are
posit
that
you
are
in
a
dream
the
other
dreamer
do
not
necessarili
know
that
thi
is
your
totem
or
how
it
actual
act
feel
look
etc
in
the
real
world

noooo
see
your
get
it
all

the
purpos
of
not
let

becaus
if

everi
detail
of

they
can
trick
you
you

well
if
they
don
t
know
that
it
s
your
totem
then
they
wouldn

know
to
manipul
it
to
trick
you
if
they
think
it
s
just
a
random
object
in
you
then
it

from

i

don

what

all
of

in

perhap
it

perhap
there
is
some
evid
or
perhap
it
all
happen
in

it
is
a

far
fetch
to
think
he

blame
for
hi

death
when
i
m
sure
the

she
plummet

her
clear

evalu
use

confirm
her
claim

be
a
danger
to
the

would
be
discard
when

she
had
commit
suicid
but
again
it
a
movi
and
we
don

about

there
are
no

he

the
particular
of

one
thing

it

that

hollywood
movi
dustin
2

as
much
as
i
respect
the
well
plan
layout
of
thi
site
i
have
problem
with
your
argument
1
wa
saito
truli
power
enough
to
make
one
phone
call
and
end
cobb
s
problem
or
wa
that
just
cobb
in

project
hi
subconsci
wish
to
go
home
you
can
argu
logist
all
you
want
but
if
it
s
said
that
saito
is
a
power
and
wealthi
man
he
bought
a
whole
airlin
on
a
whim
then
there
s
reason
enough
to
infer
that
he
could
bend
the
legal
system
for
cobb
rich
power
peopl
bend
law
all
the
time
you
assum
saito
isn
t
a
project
i
m
argu
from
the
perspect
that
hi
wife
wa
inde
correct
in
believ
that
the
real
world
leonardo
came
back
into
wa
still
a
dream
did
cobb
s
father
michael
cain
arrang
to
meet
him
at
the
airport
or
is
he
there
becaus
he
s
cobb
s
project
at
thi
point
we
re
read
way
too
much
into
thing
there
is
a
phone
on
the
plane
so
cobb
could
ve
easili
arrang
for
pickup
thi
wa
also
an
intric
plan
they
were
hatch
so
arrang
for
airport
pickup
would
probabl
be
on
the
to
do
list
but
yet
one
point
remain
clear
and
is
repeat
one
shot
show
cobb
see
hi
father
at
the
airport
the
next
show
him
at
home
with
hi
father
it
s
read
too
much
into
it
to
assum
that
cobb
knew
how
he
actual
got
home
in
earli
dream
scene
cobb
is
wear
a
wed
band
that
doesn
t
appear
in
the
real
world
scene
or
the
end
scene
in
the
airport
doe
that
mean
the
end
is
realiti
detail
like
that
are
certainli
strong
evid
that
there
is
a
real
world
and
that
cobb
doe
live
in
it
at
time
such
as
when
he
isn
t
wear
a
wed
band
in
a
dream
one
can
manipul
object
at
will
sometim
if
he
is
inde
convinc
that
hi
real
world
is
real
then
he
would
perceiv
himself
without
the
ring
quit
simpl
realli
doe
the
fact
that
cobb
use
mal
s
totem
mean
it
doesn
t
work
as
a
totem
and
therefor
he
never
know
if
he
s
in
realiti
or
not
again
we
re
read
a
littl
too
deep
into
thing
the
onli
peopl
who
know
the
weight
and
feel
of
that
totem
are
mal
and
cobb
and
sinc
mal
is
dead
cobb
is
the
onli
one
left
who
know
the
totem
s
tactil
detail
so
ye
he
could
certainli
use
it
as
a
measur
of
realiti
the
totem
wa
not
ruin
by
him
use
it
thi
also
goe
along
with
the
wed
ring
he
can
manipul
the
object
all
he
want
what
give
that
certain
object
ani
special
abil
over
ani
cup
or
bowl
in
hi
dream
especi
if
he
s
the
architect
at
the
end
cobb
s
kid
seem
to
be
the
same
age
and
are
seemingli
wear
the
same
cloth
as
they
were
in
hi
memori
of
them
is
it
proof
he
s
still
dream
as
care
document
by
our
own
vic
holtreman
at
the
end
of
the
film
cobb
s
kid
are
wear
similar
outfit
to
the
one
he
rememb
but
their
shoe
are
differ
as
for
their
age
if
you
check
imdb
there
are
actual
two
set
of
actor
credit
with
play
cobb
s
kid
the
daughter
phillipa
is
credit
as
be
both
3
and
5
year
old
while
the
son
jame
is
credit
as
be
both
20
month
and
3
year
old
thi
suggest
that
while
it
might
be
subtl
there
is
a
differ
between
the
kid
in
cobb
s
memori
and
the
kid
cobb
come
home
to
that
would
suggest
the
homecom
is
in
fact
realiti
but
feel
free
to
debat
that
he
can
also
manipul
what
hi
kid
look
like
base
upon
hi
own
belief
in
the
dream
what
is
clear
though
is
that
the
human
mind
isn
t
truli
revolutionari
in
creat
it
s
own
idea
it
draw
off
previou
or
exist
detail
so
he
alter
the
shoe
and
age
big
deal
what
is
strike
are
the
similar
will
the
spin
top
keep
spin
or
wa
it
about
to
fall
over
just
befor
nolan
cut
to
black
again
what
doe
it
matter
if
he

tyken
at

point
did

i
think
we
must
assum
she
did
spin
it
whether
cobb
ever
tri
it
himself
would
be
anoth
question
but
what
happen
when
she
spin
it
if
it
fall
mal
would
just
look
for
other
excus
to
support
her
deepli
incept
belief
she
even
say
to
cobb
that
their
current

seem
real
to
him

becaus
he
believ
it

hi
belief
are
overrid
her
here
in

she
still
believ

perhap
a

level
again
the
confus
concern
even
thi

allow

the

did
keep
on

well
i

let
you
come

if

fell

2

here
is
anoth
point
about
the
dream
when
they
all
went
under
on
the
plane
it
wa
rain
becaus
the
one
guy
had
to
take
a
leak
right
well
when
they
got
the
kick
and
to
wake
up
when
the
van
wa
fall
off
the
bridg
it
wa
still
rain
so
doe
that
mean
that
they
were
still
at
that
one
level
down
in
the
dream
after
all
and
not
in
the
real
world
martin
phipp
2
year

of
cours
the
kick
brought
them
back
to
the
first
level
they
woke
up
when
the
sed
wore
off
likewis
cobb
and
saito
were
never
in
danger
of
go
into
a
coma
and
not
wake
up
the
danger
wa
that
they
would
not
rememb
who
they
were
when
they
woke
up
we
see
saito
go
for
a
gun
presum
to
shoot
himself
so
he
would
wake
up
but
it
could
be
they
woke
up
becaus
the
sed
had
worn
off
which
is
a
good
point
there
s
no
doubt
that
cobb
woke
up
on
the
plane
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
the
entir
movi
wa
a
dream
sambo
2
year

i
think
it
is
also
import
to
make
the
distinct
between
the
entir
movi
wa
a
dream
versu
the
entir
movi
take
place
within
dreamshar
and
limbo

alright
so
i
know
the
debat
of
the
film
is
over
i
just
got
done
watch
it
and
wa
wonder
if
anyon
els
had
thi
thought
is
it
possibl
that
the
colleg
girl
architect
wa
investig
cobb
and
that
the
reason
cobb
wa
sent
free
wa
becaus
it
wa
determin
by
hi
encount
with
hi
wife
at
the
end
of
the
film
that
he
truli
did
not
kill
hi
wife
i
know
there
aren
t
ani
direct
statement
within
the
film
to
prove
thi
theori
to
be
correct
but
it
s
an
interest
thought
that
dure
thi
incept
cobb
may
have
been
under
investig
for
the
murder
of
hi
wife
sambo
2

fresh
take
adam
nice
angl
i
like
it
the
more
theori
the
better
in
my
opinion
as
long
as
they
onli
contradict
audienc
assumpt
and
not
the
fact
as
they
are
state
ahmauri613
2
year
ago
i
watch
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
wa
satisfi
but
then
i
kept
think
whi
are
the
kid
still
wear
the
same
thing
and
in
the
same
spot
whi
are
they
the
same
age
as
when
he
left
whi
don
t
we
see
the
top
stop
spin
so
i
ask
is
he
the
one
that
is
still
dream
and
hi
wife
right
and
she
out
but
he
s
still
in
help
me
jo
2
year
ago
nice
explan
but
the
key
is
in
yusuf
basement
when
cobb
goe
into
sleep
and
dream
about
mal
he
fall
into
limbo
there
and
the
rest
of
all
movi
is
a
cobb
dream
you
can
notic
that
when
he
suposli
wake
up
from
that
dream
the
top
fall
to
the
ground
and
never
wa
test
the
onli
thing
that
chang
is
the
way
cobb
think
about
it
relat
with
mal
archaeon
2

jo
the
key
as
you
see
it
plenti
of
other
have
found
just
as
much

he

to
get

in
the

caus
that
the
onli
place
he
can
see
hi

face
assur
of

princ
inferno
2
year
ago
there
wa
one
small
scene
that
i
notic
when
cobb
is
find
hi
team
he
meet
up
with
the
gentleman
forgiv
me
for
not
know
the
charact
name
that
ha
a
room
full
of
men
that
share
dream
togeth
the
man
state
that
the
dream
are
extrem
stabl
cobb
ha
a
dream
about
mal
hi
dead
crazi
wife
and
then
wake
himself
up
when
he
goe
into
the
bathroom
to
check
and
see
if
he
is
still
dream
sato
the
guy
make
the
deal
with
him
interrupt
him
and
ask
him
if
everyth
is
all
right
cobb
pick
up
the
totem
and
walk
away
say
ye
could
it
be
possibl
that
he
wa
sleep
for
8
hour
like
the
rest
if
the
men
in
the
room
and
dreamt
that
he
complet
the
job
and
went
home
to
hi
kid
in
addit
after
that
moment
in
the
bathroom
cobb
never
pull
out
the
totem
until
the
end
food
for
thought
tykjen
2
year
ago
nah
cobb
follow
up
after
that
with
the
experi
and
besid
saito
had
seen
the
totem
mani
mani
year
ago
and
he
did
in
that
bathroom
voidokm
2
year
ago
that
doesn
t
realli
matter
i
think
peopl
seem
to
forget
that
the
special
object
onli
work
if
you
are
in
somebodi
els
s
dream
becaus
of
the
whole
not
be
allow
to
know
the
weight
of
the
object
becaus
if
the
dreamer
know
the
object
then
the
dreamer
can
manipul
the
object
and
make
it
do
the
correct
action
so
if
cobb
wa
in
hi
own
dream
down
in
yusuf
s
room
then
whether
or
not
saito
knock
it
down
doesn
t
matter
becaus
cobb
can
dream
the
object
to
do
whatev
he
want
so
with
that
piec
of
inform
i
don
t
think
that
he
is
still
dream
when
he
spin
becaus
that
would
be
a
major
plothol
consid
it
doesn
t
even
matter
in
hi
own
dream
martin
2
year
ago
the
top
wa
origin
mal
s
totem
and
he
said
that
mal
could
make
the
top
spin
and
spin
forev
and
presum
he
could
too
and
that
wa
how
he
convinc
her
that
she
wa
dream
now
if
they
move
one
level
up
mal
should
realiz
that
they
are
still
dream
and
tri
the
top
and
presum
she
did
and
it
spun
and
spun
and
she
wa
convinc
that
she
wa
still
dream
but
she
couldn
t
convinc
cobb
he
wa
so
convinc
that
he
wa
in
the
real
world
that
when
he
saw
the
top
it
would
stop
spin
but
in
the
end
he
isn
t
look
at
the
top
so
it
keep
spin
so
that
suggest
that
he
had
been
dream
the
whole
movi
i
think
terryfinn
s
argument
for
him
be
in
a
dream
world
is
the
simplest
yet
although
it
could
also
be
argu
that
it
wa
just
someth
that
nolan
either
overlook
or
didn
t
show
perhap
they
did
kill
themselv
a
few
more
time
to
get
back
to
realiti
but
she
wa
still
unconvinc
that
her
world
wa
real
the
spin
top
at
the
end
howev
suggest
that
they
didn
t
and
that
they
were
still
dream
vantasia
2
year
ago
i
love
thi
movi
it
s
probabl
the
best
movi
i
ve
ever
seen
they
had
a
veri
unusu
stori
line
and
i
like
it
i
wa
also
pull
in
to
how
they
end
up
be
put
in
a
dream
then
anoth
dream
and
so
forth
i
wa
intrigu
by
the
paradox
and
imposs
shape
and
physic
i
thought
it
wa
fascin
how
the
time
wa
distort
accord
to
dissimilar
level
they
had
10
hour
in
realiti
day
in
the
1st
level
week
in
the
2nd
level
a
decad
in
the
3rd
level
and
decad
in
limbo
overal
i
thought
thi
movi
wa
outstand
just
a
guy
2
year
ago
doesn
t
realli
matter
whether
or
not
cobb
is
still
in
limbo
or
return
to
the
real
world
all
that
realli
matter
is
that
he
is
with
hi
children
real
or
not
and
is
ultim
a
happier
person
than
what
he
wa
in
the
begin
of
the
movi
even
if
it
is
just
fals
happi
creat
by
hi
own
subconsci
my
view
the
end
wa
left
to
keep
you
guess
so
i
don
t
think
there
need
to
be
a
concret
answer
doesn
t
matter
how
much
you
want
one
you
won
t
get
it
the
end
is
a
big
teas
and
i
like
it
that
way
whi
am
i
comment
i
just
watch
the
movi
again
and
i
felt
like
it
random
note
laugh
realli
hard
that
scarecrow
wa
the
man
who
got
incept
yeah
dude
you
use
toxin
to
make
peopl
hallucin
huh
well
i
just
went
into
your
mind
and
put
your
subconsci
into
a
dream
into
a
dream
and
then
into
anoth
dream
to
just
mess
with
you
man
yeah
who
s
the
ba
now
love
it
you
actual
read
thi
comment

go
but
i
just
wast
like
a
minut
of
your
life

is
some
good
news
i
wast

minut
of
my
life

minut
of
your
life

i
basic
screw
myself
over
oh
well
robyn
2
year
ago
just
been
read
all
the
comment
and
realli
like
all
the
theori
i
m
not
sure
what
i
think
but
is
thi
a
valid
idea
what
if
we
are
alway
in
cobb
dream
and
mal
keep
tri
to
enter
it
to
wake
him
and
in
limbo
near
the
end
mal
realis
that
she
is
loos
the
battl
to
convinc
cobb
that
he
is
dream
and
decid
never
to
come
back
doe
that
mean
is
is
alway
in
a
limbo
but
if
he
is
whi
isnt
cobb
or
the
chrildren
get
older
or
is
he
project
himself
in
that
imagd
is
ani
of
that
even
possibl
or
have
i
miss
the
idea
i
m
get
mind
boggl
from
thi
film
and
now
question
everyth
about
it
like
mal
but
thi
is
definatli
realiti
we
are
in
raffi1990
2
year
ago
well
cobb
actual
reveal
to
ariadn
how
hi
totem
work
so
the
end
might
aswel
be
ariadn
work
the
fact
that
cobb
and
saito
dont
wake
up
in
the
van
like
everyon
els
but
they
wake
up
straight
into
the
plane
could
be
a
hint
that
cobb
actual
never
reach
saito
but
from
the
moment
he
wa
on
the
beach
into
saito
limbo
he
wa
actual
in
ariadn
dream
architectur
so
that
would
mean
that
with
ariadn
know
how
cobb
s
totem
work
she
might
aswel
fool
him
into
think
it
the
real
world
even
if
in
realiti
cobb
is
dream
terryfinn
2
year

a
few
simpl
detail
the
more
level
deep
you
are
the
more
time
you
will
have
to
kill

within
a

bring
you
back
to
the

mal
and
cobb

which
we
think
is
atleast
four
level
deep
they
were
wait
for
a
train
and
when
the
train
hit
them
they
wake
up
wait
don
t
they
have
to
kill
themselv
three
more
time
after

martin
2
year
ago
sound
legit
arthur
onli
move
up
one
level
when
he
die
in
the
open
sequenc
tykjen
2
year
ago
arthur
wa
not
under
a
power
sed
dure
the
first
mission
on
saito
that
whi
he
woke
up
one
level
abov
if
you
ask
me
perhap
the
level
abov
cobb
and
mal
in
limbo
had
collaps
becaus
they
die
in
the
dreamlevel
while
influenc
by
a
power
sed
and
that
how
they
end
up
in
limbo
in
the
first
place
when
cobb
and
saito
escap
limbo
in
the
end
the
level
abov
them
are
gone
martin
2
year
ago
it
wasn
t
made
clear
due
to
the
frantic
pace
of
the
action
and
henc
littl
time
for
exposit
but
i
take
it
that
cobb
and
saito
woke
up
when
the
sed
wore
off
cobb
had
to
find
saito
and
remind
him
that
hi
world
wa
not
real
so
that
he
would
rememb
who
he
wa
when
he
woke
up
and
be
abl
to
make
the
phone
call
that
would
enabl
cobb
to
see
hi
famili
that
bring
up
anoth
point
though
if
cobb
and
mal
were
in
limbo
for
50
year
then
didn
t
their
sed
wear
off
and
if
it
didn
t
wear
off
becaus
they
had
taken
too
much
then
would
kill
themselv
in
the
dream
work
some
peopl
say
that
cobb
and
saito
shot
themselv
and
woke
up
but
that
should
onli
work
if
the
sed
had
worn
off
so
if
the
sed
ha
worn
off
then
kill
yourself
in
the
dream
wake
up
but
if
the
sed
ha
not
worn
off
then
kill
yourself
in
the
dream
won
t
work
so
what
doe
that
mean
with
arthur
in
the
open
scene
he
die
in
the
dream
but
he
onli
goe
up
one
level
oh
i
see
it
is
becaus
the
architect
wa
still
dream
and
arthur
wa
in
hi
dream
and
arthur
could
not
wake
up
until
hi
dream
wa
over
not
unless
he
die
again
with
the
sed
have
worn
off
saito
and
cobb
could
wake
up
becaus
the
ame
arthur
and
the
chemist
had
alreadi
woken
up
as
you
say
the
dream
had
collaps
becaus
the
dreamer
had
woken
up
but
then
that
bring
up
anoth
question
who
went
to
sleep
with
mal
and
cobb
that
they
were
abl
to
get
to
limbo
and
stay
there
for
50
year
that
wa
never
explain
for
the
job
they
need
at
least
three
peopl
one
person
dream
each
level
i
don
t
see
how
cobb
and
mal
reach
limbo
by
work
alon
that
wa
never
explain
could
they
take
turn
with
cobb
dream
the
first
level
and
mal
dream
the
second
level
etc
but
then
the
level
abov
them
haven
t
collaps
becaus
they
are
the
one
dream
those
level
oop
tykjen
2
year
ago
they
were
on
a
power
sed
went
into
the
first
level
and
die
then
woke
up
to
a
new
realiti
call
limbo
arthur
howev
wa
not
on
a
power
sed
so
he
woke
up
the
level
abov
as
usual
archaeon
2
year
ago
tykjen
that
is
how
i
understood
it
also
didn
t
they
actual
explain
thi
in
the
film
i
ve
never
felt
ani
confus
about
thi
particular
issu
tykjen
2
year

inde
no
confus
what
so
ever
but
mani
peopl
in
these
comment
are
inde
confus
martin
2
year

but
you
are
forget
that
it
isn
t
normal
for
peopl
to
take
drug
go
to
sleep
and
then
wake
up
not
know
what
is
real
oh
wait
i
take
it
back
that
is
exactli
what
happen
when
you
take
drug
assum
you
wake
up
at
all
never

2

the
particular
of
mal
and
cobb
s
get
to
limbo
were
intent
gloss
over
the
best
we
got
wa
that
they
went
too
deep
sambo
2
year
ago
we
can
onli
assum
they
die
to
get
to
limbo
just
as
we
can
onli
assum
that
there
are
onli
4
level
of
dreamshar
the
lack
of
specif
serv
the
ambigu
henc
the
lack
of
specif
joop
2
year
ago
as
i
understand
it
the
limbo
is
not
a
higher
level
of
dreamstat
rather
it
is
an
unconstruct
dreamstat
as
mention
in
the
film
therefor
you
can
fall
into
a
limbo
without
have
construct
multipl
dream
layer
you
can
just
construct
a
singl
dream
layer
then
kill
yourself
to
fall
into
an
unconstruct
limbo
on
the
supposit
that
you
are
under
a
strong
enough
sedat
and
that
how
cobb
and
mal
were
abl
to
fall
into
a
limbo
without
extra
personel
they
took
a
strong
sed
that
would
stop
them
from
wake
up
befor
it
would
ware
off
and
kill
themselv
at
the
first
level
of
dreamstat
thu
fall
into
an
unconstruct
limbo
where
mal
refus
to
wake
up
kill
her
self
even
after
the
sedat
would
have
worn
off
becaus
she
accept
the
limbo
as
realiti
lose
her
mind
like
when
adrin
tell
cobb
after
he
decid
to
stay
in
the
limbo
to
find
saito
dont
lose
your
mind
cobb
then
had
to
convinc
her
that
they
were
in
a
limbo
and
they
kill
themselv
wake
up
after
spend
a
lifetim
in
the
limbo
archaeon
2
year

ye
tykjen
2
year
ago
but
cobb
did
speak
from
experi
i
dont
think
they
went
in
onli
one
level
befor
they
end
up
in
limbo
i
believ
cobb
and
mal
experi
with
great
depth
but
ultim
lot
of
stuff
went
wrong
and
year
went
by
play
god
in
limbo
after
one
of
them
die
and
one
perhap
follow
the
scene
at
the
anniversari
could
that
be
when
there
is
so
much
that
is
unsaid
in
incept
which
we
can
onli
imagin
whi
did
mal
want
to
stay
in
limbo
and
not
wake
up
at
one
time
they
both
understood
limbo
but
mal
chose
to
stay
there
she
fool
herself
with
her
own
totem
place
it
toppl
in
realiti
mode
in
her
own
safe
she
did
thi
on
purpos
to
herself
yet
anoth
experi
that
went
wrong
joop
2
year
ago
ye
you
are
right
cobb
did
say
that
he
and
mal
experi
with
dream
stage
and
imo
base
strictli
on
my
assumpt
dure
those
experi
possibl
with
other
peopl
and
sometim
cobb
stay
on
one
level
and
mal
go
into
anoth
they
may
have
stumbl
upon
the
exist
of
the
limbo
then
they
both
decid
to
go
into
limbo
togeth
via
the
method
i
have
suggest
abov
without
the
help
of
other
and
they
did
spend
year
play
god
in
the
limbo
dure
which
mal
lost
her
mind
the
attract
of
the
limbo
wa
too
great
similar
to
whi
ariadn
came
back
to
cobb
s
workshop
and
decid
to
lockaway
her
symbol
of
realiti
into
her
subconsci
safe
lose
her
sens
of
what
real
and
what
isnt
complet
cobb
who
wa
still
awar
use
incept
break
into
her
subconsci
safe
and
spin
her
totem
to
plant
the
idea
in
mal
s
mind
that
the
limbo
is
a
dream
and
they
both
kill
themselv
togeth
by
go
under
the
train
after
they
came
back
to
realiti
the
idea
that
cobb
had
put
into
mal
s
subconsci
kept
own
grow
like
a
viru
and
eventu
mal
start
to
doubt
the
world

okay
i
see
where
you
are
go
with
thi
so
they
kill
themselv
in
their
dream
to
wake
up
but
becaus
they
have
taken
a
strong
sed
they
don
t
wake
up
but
go
into
limbo
they
need
to
spend
year
in
limbo
becaus
it
wa
a
strong
sed
and
they
will
need
to
have
a
few
hour
pass
in
the
real
world
if
the
sed
is
to
wear
off
they
kill
themselv
again
and
cobb
believ
he
is
back
in
the
real
world
but
mal
is
not
sure
she
kill
herself
but
she
is
unabl
to
convinc
cobb
to
kill
himself
so
is
cobb
still
dream
or
not
i
think
they
were
still
dream
becaus
i
don
t
think
the
dream
abov
them
had
collaps
that
make
a
big
differ
arthur
die
in
a
dream
but
he
didn
t
wake
up
he
just
went
up
one
level
cobb
and
saito
may
have
woken
up
from
limbo
but
cobb
that
is
irrelev
becaus
cobb
is
still
dream
we
didn
t
actual
see
cobb
and
saito
shoot
each
other
the
fact
that
they
realiz
they
were
in
a
dream
with
the
sed
have
worn
off
may
have
been
enough
to
caus
them
to
wake
up
tykjen
2
year
ago
dure
the
saito
mission
arthur
wa
kill
in
level
2
and
woke
up
in
level
1
same
with
saito
who
thought
he
wa
wake
up
in
hi
own
apart
in
realiti
cobb
wa
woken
up
with
a
kick
sinc
the
slap
he
got
from
nash
didnt
do
anyth
see
veri
stabl
normal
procedur
for
dreamshar
to
wake
up
when
you
die
but
the
thing
with
the
mission
wa
someth
new
someth
even
the
great
saito
didnt
know
they
were
2
level
down
and
the
same
rule
still
appli
if
arthur
had
been
kill
in
level
1
hed
woken
up
on
the
train
in
realiti
joop
2
year
ago
as
we
all
seem
to
be
assum
out
of
context
here
veri
interestingli
so
i
think
if
mal
did
wake
up
instead
of
fall
to
her
death
she
d
sure
have
tri
to
wake
up
cobb
by
give
him
the
kick
which
is
quicker
and
more
effect
than
come
back
to
hi
subconsci
and
persuad
him
to
kill
hisself
and
so
the
fact
that
we
dont
see
cobb
be
given
the
kick
apart
from
the
one
involv
in
the
job
i
would
say
that
argument
is
a
lil
farfetch
nonetheless
veri
imagin
and
engag
sambo
2
year
ago
that
s
whi
i
valu
the
ambigu
surround
the
possibilti
that
the
pair
of
them
reach
limbo
not
through
a
first
level
death
but
through
a
much
deeper
level
death
which
of
cours
is
to
indulg
the
assumpt
that
more
than
4
dream
level
are
a
possibl
but
if
anyon
can
give
me
someth
solid
to
disprov
the
idea
i
d
be
happi
to
close
the
book
on
it
sambo
2
year
ago
the
signific
of
which
i
should
add
is
the
extend
time
ratio
which
multipl
level
would
provid
the
time
it
take
for
mal
to
stand
up
and
give
him
the
kick
could
be
a
year
for
cobb
also
the
limbo
to
realiti
time
ratio
is
never
given
to
us
explicitli
and
for
that
matter
if
you
go
to
limbo
from
level
1
is
your
time
ratio
to
realiti
the
same
as
if
you
go
to
limbo
from
level
4
or
how
s
that
work
doe
limbo
have
a
time
ratio
constant
sqlguy
2
year

the
movi
seem
to
establish
though
that
a
differ
dreamer
in
the
same
dreamshar
wa
need
for
each
level
with
onli
cobb
and
mal
they
shouldn
t
have
been
abl
to
go
more
than
two
level
down
and
then
one
of
them
would
alreadi
have
been
left
out
for
the
type
of
timescal
differ
you
re
suggest
between
cobb
and
a
woken
up
mal
they
would
have
had
to
have
been
mani
more
level
down
and
they
would
have
need
a
few
more
dreamer
sambo
2
year
ago
not
necessarili
the
movi
onli
establish
the
guidelin
like
that
becaus
it
is
essenti
for
the
team
to
have
a
strategi
for
kick
themselv
back
to
realiti
henc
the
differ
dreamer
in
each
level
i
posit
that
take
turn
between
2
peopl
could
have
work
after
all
the
pasiv
devic
is
new
technolog
and
even
cobb
still
experi
with
it
and
he
is
consid
an
expert
to
some
degre
so
sure
we
can
t
be
sure
of
anyth
that
isn
t
otherwis
state
in
the
film
tykjen
2
year
ago
agre
who
s
to
say
they
couldn
t
take
turn
after
all
they
were
experi
go
deeper
and
deeper
further
downward
is
the
onli
way
forward
sambo
2
year

btw
on
a
strong
sed
1
20
one
need
onli
be
4
level
deep
to
turn
2
second
into
370
day
i
can
show
you
the
math
if
you
like
tykjen
2
year
ago
but
the
problem
is
if
you
wake
kick
up
someon
from
limbo
they
will
be
in
a
state
of
coma
it
wa
import
for
teh
subject
to
truli
know
that
limbo
wasnt
real
befor
leav
but
mal
wa
not
sure
when
she
left
with
cobb
mal
love
cobb
too
much
and
want
to
leav
with
him
on
the
traintrack
without
question
but
when
mal
wa
leav
cobb
he
could
not
he
wa
alway
so
sure
what
wa
real
or
not
but
mal
wa
the
complex
one
who
realli
knew
the
absolut
they
could
be
100
certain
that
they
could
never
be
sure
and
the
incept
sadli
caus
mal
to
be
fix
on
the
idea
given
by
cobb
you
world
is
not
real
she
got
that
idea
in
limbo
after
50
year
must
have
been
tough
to
leav
sambo
2
year
ago
i
forgot
that
thank
ty
also
1
do
you
think
it
is
possibl
for
a
kick
to
reach
from
realiti
to
limbo
if
the
interven
dream
level
have
alreadi
been
deconstruct
and
2
if
they
went
from
the
first
level
to
limbo
what
do
you
imagin
their
time
ratio
would
be
as
i
wa
get
at
tykjen
2
year
ago
great
depth
wa
a
hot
topic
of
discuss
within
incept
so
i
firmli
believ
cobb
and
mal
experi
with
3
level
thi
is
veri
import
to
not
overlook
becaus
cobb
speak
of
experi
yusuf
say
at
first
it
imposs
when
talk
about
3
level
cobb
say
one
onli
ha
to
add
a
sed
yusuf
correct
cobb
by
ad
power
sed
to
which
cobb
nod
without
say
a
word
as
for
your
question
i
dont
think
a
kick
in
realiti
would
wake
up
anyon
from
limbo
anyon
who
is
in
limbo
need
to
be
deliv
a
messag
that
it
not
real
befor
they
can
leav
is
my
inkl
anyway
eam
is
the
one
who
onli
brush
upon
that
if
one
end
in
limbo
and
wake
up
from
it
there
a
great
chanc
youd
have
brain
for
scrambl
egg
as
for
your
second
point
i
see
limbo
as
it
own
level
with
it
own
time
compress
one
could
die
in
level
3
and
go
there
or
in
level
1
and
go
there
and
the
time
compress
doe
not
matter
down
there
1
second
in
realiti
can
be
a
year
for
that
matter
in
limbo
limbo
is
for
me
also
a
state
of
mind
outsid
realiti
where
there
are
no
rule
no
time
sambo
2
year
ago
yeah
i
think
i
tend
to
agre
limbo
would
have
it
s
own
independ
time
ratio
and
as
it
is
pretti
much
the
act
of
one
directli
interfac
with
their
subconsci
one
would
expect
that
it
would
be
at
maximum
ratio
whatev
that
might
be
joop
2
year
ago
pleas
do
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
didnt
ariadn
wake
up
from
a
limbo
unconstructur
dream
she
went
into
with
cobb
to
find
fischer
by
throw
herself
off
cobb
mal
apart
and
she
and
other
rode
the
synchronis
kick
to
the
first
level
to
wait
for
the
sed
to
wear
off
the
reason
whi
cobb
who
also
eventu
die
from
the
mal
inflict
stab
wound
in
the
limbo
didnt
wake
up
is
becaus
the
dream
right
up
abov
had
collaps
dream
3
eam
and
2
arthur
and
drown
in
the
first
dream
yusef
henc
he
got
lost
into
a
further
limbo
wake
up
on
saito
s
arm
shore
the
onli
way
cobb
and
saito
could
get
out
of
the
limbo
now
wa
to
wait
for
the
sed
to
wear
off
and
hope
that
the
team
would
give
them
the
kick
as
soon
as
they
awok
therefor
the
limbo
is
not
a
coma
it
mere
an
unconstruct
dream
from
which
you
can
easili
awak
with
a
kick
howev
the
problem
in
thi
case
wa
that
everyon
who
could
give
cobb
saito
the
kick
wa
also
still
in
the
dream
and
they
were
all
under
a
strong
sed
set
on
a
timer
which
is
a
loooong
time
for
saito
and
thi
is
the
reason
whi
cobb
chose
to
stay
in
the
limbo
to
find
saito
not
becaus
saito
would
fall
into
a
coma
and
never
wake
up
but
becaus
saito
could
forget
who
he
wa
and
could
becom
mental
ill
when
he
wake
up
like
mal
that
whi
we
see
cobb
and
saito
exchang
a
dialogu
in
saito
s
castl
remind
themselv
of
who
they
were
even
cobb
seem
confus
and
thi
is
also
whi
we
see
cobb
and
saito
wake
up
natur
on
the
plane
rather
than
through
a
kick
becaus
the
team
couldn
t
know
for
sure
if
cobb
had
manag
to
remind
saito
of
the
truth
so
they
put
away
all
the
equip
so
that
fischer
wouldnt
get
suspici
but
left
cobb
and
saito
to
sleep
thi
doe
not
mean
to
say
that
cobb
actual
woke
up
into
realiti
go
to
find
saito
wa
cobb
s
plan
which
ariadn
knew
and
how
cobb
imagagin
he
would
wake
up
so
it
could
be
either
and
sambo
if
as
you
say
there
wa
anoth
level
into
which
cobb
and
mal
awok
from
their
limbo
train
track
death
and
that
cobb
is
still
on
thi
dream
level
while
mal
could
be
a
level
higher
or
even
in
suppos
realiti
then
the
time
differ
between
mal
and
cobb
may
not
be
year
but
minut
or
hour
becaus
cobb
will
not
in
a
limbo
anymor
but
in
one
of
their
structur
dream
1
or
2
level
abov
depend
on
how
mani
they
creat
so
if
mal
wa
to
give
him
the
kick
in
whichev
stage
that
she
may
be
throughout
the
timespan
of
the
movi
at
least
a
few
week
we
should
have
seen
cobb
feel
the
kick
or
some
even
sort
of
a
sign
sambo
2
year
ago
limbo
or
not
if
cobb
is
again
that
s
if
he
is
by
some
chanc
5
layer
deep
1
second
in
realiti
would
be
just
over
ten
year
to
him
sambo
2
year
ago
so
he
should
be
expect
mal
s
kick
anytim
in
the
next
20
to
30
year
or
so
lol
let
s
hope
she
doesn
t
decid
to
go
to
the
bathroom
first
ha
sambo
2
year
ago
that
is
on
a
1
20
sed
as
yusuf
suggest
i
should
add
without
sed
the
ratio
is
1

joop
2

ye
you
are
right
haha
scari
but
if
as
u
say
they
were
5
dream
deep
and
the
lvl
abov
hadn
t
collaps
kill
yourself
at
level
5
as
mal
did
by
jump
from
her
hotel
room
would
onli
bring
you
to
the
next
level
up
4
so
we
d
have
to
calcul
the
time
differ
between
lvl
5
and
lvl4
rather
than
lvl
5
and
realiti
to
see
when
mal
kick
would
reach
cobb
joop
2

sorri
for
all
the

error
lol
aw

ur

joop
2

furthermor
have
debat
over
the
valid
of
cobb
s
totem
and
whether
it
wa
about
to
toppl
at
the
veri
end
is
counterproduct
and
will
have
us
circl
in
a
paradox
loop
1
saito
s
handl
of
cobb
s
totem
doe
not
ruin
it
purpos
they
were
alreadi
in
a
construct
dream
the
reason
whi
arthur
teach
ariadn
to
keep
her
totem
safe
from
other
reach
is
becaus
if
an
architect
in
the
real
world
get
hold
of
her
totem
and
observ
it
purpos
then
the
architect
is
be
abl
to
imit
such
a
totem
and
construct
it
into
hi
architectur
defeat
the
purpos
and
integr
of
ariadn
s
totem
therefor
the
integr
of
cobb
s
totem
is
protect
throughout
the
film
the
onli
other
person
who
knew
about
the
totem
mal
is
dead
2
the
end
doesnt
simpli
pivot
around
the
simpl
notion
that
if
the
totem
spin
on
it
a
dream
and
if
it
toppl
it
realiti
we
must
take
note
of
the
scene
where
cobb
tri
to
persuad
mal
of
the
fact
that
they
are
in
realiti
by
confront
her
with
hi
inabl
to
control
hi
totem
mal
argu
back
say
that
becaus
you
dont
know
you
are
dream
thi
is
a
veri
veri
import
factor
the
last
dreamstat
or
limbo
cobb
put
himself
into
is
hi
own
the
previou
dream
of
eam
arthur
and
yusef
have
collaps
due
to
the
synchronis
kick
let
suppos
cobb
wa
still
in
the
limbo
when
he
came
home
to
hi
kid
from
the
moment
cobb
wake
up
on
the
plane
he
look
confus
and
he
check
the
other
to
see
if
anyth
is
strang
he
get
home
and
still
veri
unsur
spin
hi
totem
but
befor
he
could
see
if
it
toppl
he
run
to
see
hi
kid
now
up
until
thi
veri
moment
cobb
had
restrict
himself
from
see
hi
kid
face
until
he
wa
sure
that
they
were
real
but
now
he
s
not
so
sure
he
doenst
know
for
a
fact
that
thi
is
real
but
hi
want
to
believ
that
it
real
mal
what
do
you
believ
ha
carri
him
from
the
aiport
to
hi
home
and
to
hi
kid
but
then
whi
doe
the
totem
seem
like
