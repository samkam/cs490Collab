escap
from
at

look
veri
similar

stori
the

10

half
the

whilst

in

the

wasn

need
it
wa
complet
overblown
and
mere
flashi
filler
it
bare
no

to
the

whatsoev
and
thi
is
what
you
will
come
to
expect
from
the

thereaft
now
of

we

thi
franchis
is
a
comedi
of

a

set
comedi
action
thriller
for
everyon
to
enjoy
the

realli
work
well
thi

ad
that
horrend
cartoonish
hijinx
that
total
tore
you
away
from
ani
suspens
of
disbelief
becaus
it
went
beyond
that
into
a
pure
hokey
farc
on
top
of
the
ludicr
tomfooleri
now
on
show
thi
film
ha
easili
had
much
more
creativ
influenc
from
the
classic
videogam
the
secret
of
monkey
island
if
you
know
the
game
it
quit
plain
to
see
realli
the
cannib

at
the

the
murki
misti

entireti
plu
the
similar
jone
ha
to
lechuck
in

of
evil
behaviour
the
supernatur
and
look
it
is
a

becaus
the
film
is
a
good
fantasi
with
some
gorgeou
visual
both
cgi

davi

especi
