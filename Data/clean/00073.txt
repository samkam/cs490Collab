long
gone
unpunish
they
also
realiz
that
the
execution
ha
to
be
one
of
them
the
begin
of
the
novel
bore
me
a
bit
as
all
the
charact
were
be
introduc
they
were
hard
to
keep
track
of
and
my
adult
self
agre
with
my
twelv
year
old
self
in
want
them
to
get
along
with
it
i
wa
grate
when
some
of
the
charact
were
pick
off
becaus
there
were
just
too
mani
stori
it
wa
a
curiou
experinc
to
watch
event
unfold
becaus
while
i
didn
t
like
ani
of
the
victim
there
wa
a
terror
in
imagin
myself
in
their
posit
and
that
occupi
me
more
than
care
about
them
i
also
want
to
see
who
wa
next
and
in
what
unexpect
way
their
murder
would
occur
and
match
up
with
the
nurseri
rhyme
and
then
there
were
none
ha
a
terrifi
premis
and
christi
prove
to
be
the
master
of
suspens
she
is
abl
to
build
the
spine
tingl
factor
in
spite
of
a
rather
implaus
plot
would
you
realli
go
traips
off
to
some
island
without
talk
to
your
host
without
know
them
well
without
have
spoken
to
them
in
year
all
of
these
folk
do
and
while
i
didn
t
buy
it
complet
it
ultim
doesn
t
matter
the
stori
work
anyway
i
wa
on
the
edg
of
my
seat
the
entir
time
that
i
wa
read
i
m
not
sure
if
thi
is
one
of
these
novel
where
you
actual
have
the
clue
to
figur
it
out
beforehand
in
spite
of
have
read
thi
book
befor
it
wa
long
enough
ago
that
while
i
rememb
how
the
killer
wa
do
thing
i
didn
t
rememb
who
it
wa
i
had
a
strong
suspicion
though
the
manner
in
which
the
killer
is
reveal
did
leav
someth
to
be
desir
but
the
beauti
of
what
christi
accomplish
with
thi
one
still
remain
intact
and
is
definit
worth
