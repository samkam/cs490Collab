with

you

been
within

that

shrek
2
is
a

thank
in

to
the
continu
presenc
of
andrew
adamson
behind
the

as
a
co
writer
now
as
well
as

the

may

perhap
due

head
honcho
jeffrey
katzenberg
want
to
play
it
safe
to
secur
further

but
the
film
is
everi

as
funni
as
the
first
one
if
not
slightli
moreso
and
continu
to
develop

deepen
it
uniqu
fairytal

make
a

to
ani
film
can
go
one
of
two
way
depend
on
the
attitud
of
the
peopl
behind
it
and
the
potenti
present
in
the
charact
on
the
one
hand
the
film
can
repeat
all
the
basic
rhythm
of
the
first
film
either
with
the
main
charact
be
replac
so
that
the
journey
appear
to
be
new
or
by
the
stake
be
rais
so
that
it
feel
like
the
action
is
more
signific
occasion
thi
approach
work
wonder
as
on

but
often
it
result
in
tire
formula
offer
such
as
the
mani
straight
to
video
sequel
produc
by

on
the
other
hand
the
film
can
attempt
to
tell
a
new
stori
with
the
charact
undergo
a
new
challeng
and
more
characterist
of
their
univers
be
reveal
thi
approach
is
harder
to
get
right
but
when
thing
come
togeth
the
result
regularli
outclass
their

the
empir

the

warrior

down

are
all
exampl
of
thi

now
we
can
add
shrek

the
