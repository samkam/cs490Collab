the
tao
of
avatar
and
whi
thi
sort
of
movi
cannot
be
made
in
the
prc
at
thi
point
in
time
we
saw
avatar
last
night
i
know
i
ve
been
on
a
movi
kick
of
late
it
wa
visual
stun
the
stori
wa
unremark
a
melodramat
moral
tale
the
good
guy
win
in
the
end
but
it
did
have
a
coupl
of
taoist
element
which
were
no
doubt
quit
conscious
incorpor
into
the
stori
first
is
the
indirect
invoc
of
qi
ch
i
in
the
movi
the
planet
of
pandora
is
as
the
sigorney
weaver
charact
say
a
complex
organ
network
of
energi
everyth
is
interconnect
and
a
life
s
forc
energi
flow
through
and
around
all
that
is
pretti
much
the
notion
of
qi
now
strictli
speak
thi
is
not
just
a
taoist
concept
but
someth
more
gener
in
chines
cultur
confuciu
and
menciu
both
mention
qi
but
the
notion
of
qi
as
a
broader
natur
forc
which
human
must
learn
to
live
with
and
through
is
veri
much
a
part
of
taoism
in
both
it
philosoph
and
religi
form
in
the
film
the
indigen
peopl
are
abl
to
flow
with
qi
to
such
an
extent
that
they
can
use
it
as
a
restor
and
heal
forc
thi
is
the
essenc
of
chines
medicin
which
owe
much
to
taoism
work
with
the
flow
of
qi
to
gain
maximum
physic
health
the
movi
also
embrac
a
notion
of
tao
way
that
come
rather
close
to
a
taoist
understand
the
grand
matern
spirit
said
to
encompass
all
thing
is
call
upon
at
a
critic
junctur
the
hero
charact
ask
it
to
interven
in
the
consumm
battl
but
he
is
told
by
hi
indigen
lover
that
the
grand
matern
spirit
doe
not
take
side
all
inclus
but
indiffer
sound
like
the
tao
te
ching
to
me
way
is
the
mysteri
of
these
ten
thousand
thing
it
s
a
good
person
s
treasur
and
an
evil
person
s
refug
it
beauti

it
nobl

and
whatev
seek
us
we
escap
no
wonder
it
s
exalt
throughout
all
beneath

62
it
turn
out
in
the
film
that
the
grand
matern
spirit
doe
interven
at
the
crucial
moment
which
suggest
that
way
is
not
perfectli
neutral
but
may
tend
in
certain
direct
thi
to
my
mind
come
close
to
chuang

notion
of

which
provid
a
kind
of

reaction

i
felt
as
if
i
had
gone
back
to
my

becam
a
small

full
of

but
the
simpl

the

veri
engross

let
us
know
that
we
lack
not
onli
just

let
me
realiz
how
far
our
movi
are
from
simpl

how
far
our
movi
are
from
crystal
clear
puriti
how
far
our
movi
from
passion
dream
how
far
from
genuin
sincer
are
we
who
are
embroil
in
grim
entangl
and
dim
vulgar
we
ought
to
asham
in
the
face
of
the
puriti
of
avatar
thi
is
a
complet
defeat
that
we
chines
filmmak
must
collect
wit
and
conced
thi
strike
me
as
an
overreact
but
one
with
a
kernel
of
truth
i
suspect
that
chines
filmmak
will
embrac
and
expand
upon
the
technolog
of
avatar
with
littl
troubl
and
certain
kind
of
storytel
especi
melodrama
are
veri
much
a
part
of
the
chines
cinemat
repertoir
but
someth
that
distinguish
avatar
and
make
it
unlik
to
be
reproduc
in
chines
film
make
ani
time
soon
is
it
critic
natur
the
film
is
a
direct
assault
on
american
modern

and
the
bush
administr
more
particularli
ye
the
critiqu
laps
into

the

cri
out
that
we
must
fight
terror
with
terror
and
launch
a
preemptiv
attack
dick
cheney
is
clearli
the
model
here
but
they
are
critiqu
nonetheless
and
such
obviou
critic
of
specif
polit
author
and
broader
histor
trend
are
just
not
possibl
in
the
prc
given
the

the

hi
sam
i
wrote
and
post
a
long
repli
and
it
disappear
so
here
s
a
few
point
i
made
i
can
see
a
parallel
with
the
chines
notion
of
qi
but
i
think
thi
notion
occur
in
mani
aborigin
cultur
includ
the
nativ
american
cultur
same
with
the
ancestr
cult
we
have
in
the
movi
in
fact
the
movi
realli
remind
me
of
nativ
american
cultur
and
cameron
ha
conced
influenc
from
movi
like
danc
with
wolv
i
can
also
see
some
resembl
of
dao
and
eywa
but
not
too
much
eywa
doe
take
side
which
perhap
mani
religi
daoist
may
accept
but
not
my
idea
of
the
dao
and
it
work
the
float
mountain
were
larg
base
on
mountain
in
china
the
wikipedia
articl
on
the
movi
ha
a
lot
of
inform
and

to
interview
with

i
learn

of
cameron

certainli
it
is
about
imperi
in
the
sens
that
the
way
human
histori
ha
alway
work
is
that
peopl
with
more
militari
or
technolog
might
tend
to
supplant
or
destroy
peopl
who
are
weaker
usual
for
their
resourc
so
there
s
a
conscienc
within
the
film
but
it
s
not
boldli
state
it
s
kind
of
there
if
you
want
it
to
be
there
it
s
not
there
if
you
don
t
want
it
to
be
there
it
can
be
as
classic
a
stori
of
fight
back
against
cruel
might
as
star
war
you
can
take
it
back
to
the
origin
of
america
in
a
fight
of
rebel
against
an
imperi
domin
forc
you
can
interpret
it
mani
mani
differ
way
the
bad
guy
could
be
america
in
thi
movi
or
the
good
guy
could
be
america
in
thi
movi
he
say
laugh
depend
on
your
perspect
war
and
the
consequ
to
the
soldier
is
a
theme
in
my
movi
termin
ha
a
scar
soldier
charact
we
have
to
face
the
consequ
of
set
our
peopl
off
to
do
our
bid
in
a
foreign
land
but
it
s
not
a
major
undercurr
of
the
stori
i
m
not
tri
to
make
some
anti
bush
statement
although
ben
hoyl
of
the
australian
tri
to
argu
the

contain
heavi
implicit
critic
of
america

say
it
s
not
that

not
what
the

s
about
that
s
onli
a
minor
part
of

for
me
it
feel
consist

the

it

my

that
want

that
