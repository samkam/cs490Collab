i
just
couldn
t
let
go
of

your
typic
case
of
find

brown
is
sure
of
leav
more
than
evid
toward
the
true
secret
behind
thi

case
that
ha
more
behind
it
than
just
a
guilti
assassin
i
assur

it
also
ha
a
small
dose
of
love
between

take
and
be
breathless
by
the
end
of
it
although
dan
brown
s
literatur
as
a
whole
may
not
be
veri
good
it
is
apt
for
mani
age
and
great
to
be
read
as
a
fiction
fun
book
that
will
leav
you
with
a
sweet
tast
of
mouth
when
finish
the
da

code
you
will
want
to
read
more
of
dan
brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
an
amaz
book
and
i
dare
rate
it
without
a
doubt
a
5
star
book
what
s
great
about
dan
brown
is
that
he
doesn
t
stop
hi
masterpiec
here
he
continu
hi
extravag
write
in
book
like
angel
and
demon
digit
fortress
and
decept
point
so
i
can
say
without
a
doubt
that
dan
brown
is
one
of
top
author
of
thi
age
with
a

i

lukewarm
about
da
vinci
is
it
possibl
to
give
thi
book
a
middl
rate
rather
than
go
to
one
extrem
or
anoth
sure
here
s
whi
for
starter
the
book
is
in
fact
a
page
turner
onc
i
start
read
it
i
didn
t
want
to
stop
whi
becaus
everi
chapter
leav
you
hang
on
the
edg
wait
for
the
next
step
in
the
adventur
while
that
is
effect
at
keep
a
reader
involv
it
also
left
me
feel
like
i
wa
be
strung
along
and
that
the
pay
off
couldn
t
measur
up
to
the
expect
i
wa
right
it
didn
t
the
da
vinci
code
is
altogeth
entertain
and
subsequ
altogeth
forgett
it
s
actual
been
over
a
year
sinc
i
read
the
book
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
movi
refresh
my
memori
a
bit
i
would
have
forgotten
most
of
the
major
plot
point
by
now
the
onli
part
that
stuck
with
me
were
dan
brown
s
antagonist
flog
of
christian
doctrin
without
ani
real
basi
for
the
wild
claim
he
wa
make
and
the
imag
of
an
ascet
albino
murder
monk
sila
wa
much
more
memor
than
ani
of
the
protagonist
oh
i
also
enjoy
the
descript
of
rosslyn
chapel
although
that
is
mostli
becaus
i
am
interest
in
anyth
deal
with
scottish
histori
that
s
about
it
the
charact
are
mostli
forgett
becaus
brown
move
so
quickli
through
the
stori
that
there
is
no
time
for
develop
if
you
must
read
someth
by
dan
brown
angel
and
demon
is
better
better
plot
progress
more
vivid
locat
more
excit
climax
more
bewild
plot
twist
and
a
littl
less
sacrilegi
although
even
more
abras
toward
catholic
particularli
the
vatican
charact
remain
on
the
shallow
side
if
you
choos
to
buy
either
of
brown
s
langdon
seri
book
get
the
illustr
edit
i
might
not
have
even
bother
to
read
them
without
the
pictur
they
add
to
the
stori
immens
have
said
all
that
i
will
probabl
read
brown
s
next
langdon
novel
i
am
curiou
what
he
is
go
to
do
with
freemasonri
perhap
he
will
also
take
time
to
give
robert
