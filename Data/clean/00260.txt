when
jame
cameron
first
announc
he
d
be
post
convert
titan
for
a
3d
re
releas
in
april
2012
i
wa
a
bit
skeptic
after
all
i
think
most
of
us
can
agre
that
post
convert
movi
are
usual
substandard
to
one
be
shot
in
3d
and
sinc
the
movi
is
15
year
old
i
figur
it
would
be
an
insan
challeng
to
get
it
right
howev
earlier
today
i
visit
paramount
in
hollywood
and
got
to
see
about
18
minut
of
the
convert
film
on
the
big
screen
so
what
did
i
learn
never
ever
bet
against
jame
cameron
the
footag
i
saw
thi
morn
left
me
speechless
i
m
not
joke
around
when
i
say
it
s
the
best
post
convers
i
ve
ever
seen
and
it
look
like
they
origin
shot
it
in
3d
back
in
1997
in
addit
cameron
told
us
befor
they
post
convert
they
creat
a
new
4k
master
and
did
a
full
color
correct
and
clean
the
film
so
even
if
you
see
the
film
in
2d
or
3d
in
april
you
will
not
believ
how
crystal
clear
the
imag
are
and
how
good
the
film
look
howev
befor
you
start
to
think
cameron
made
ani
chang
to
the
actual
film
he
told
us
they
are
not
edit
a
singl
scene
he
s
not
pull
a
georg
luca
hit
the
jump
for
more
so
you
may
be
ask
whi
cameron
wa
abl
to
make
titan
3d
look
so
amaz
when
other
post
convert
movi
miss
the
mark
the
simpl
answer
is
time
and
money
when
a
movi
is
be
film
and
the
studio
ha
alreadi
set
a
releas
date
you
have
veri
limit
time
to
post
convert
after
all
if
the
film
use
a
lot
of
cgi
it
take
time
to
get
the
effect
deliv
and
it
also
take
time
to
edit
the
film
add
a
score
and
make
everyth
perfect
you
can
t
do
a
post
convers
until
the
film
is
almost
finish
so
it
s
hard
to
get
it
right
with
such
a
small
window
of
time
but
for
titan
cameron
ha
been
work
on
the
convers
for
60
week
and
he
s
spent
18
million
dollar
that
s
more
time
than
anyon
ha
ever
spent
on
post
convers
but
it
absolut
show
i
think
as
more
filmmak
and
studio
do
3d
re
releas
they
re
go
to
use
the
templat
set
by
cameron
to
get
it
right
at
least
i
hope
they
do
becaus
what
i
saw
today
wa
stun
and
i
have
no
qualm
recommend
thi
post
convers
to
everyon
dure
today
s
present
they
show
us
8
scene
as
you
might
imagin
cameron
and
produc
jon
landau
pick
moment
from
the
entir
film
and
they
of
cours
show
the
veri
famou
scene
of
leonardo
dicaprio
and
kate
winslet
stand
on
the
front
of
the
ship
as
the
camera
pan
around
them
i
felt
like
i
could
see
actual
depth
howev
my
favorit
scene
wa
toward
the
end
of
the
film
when
winslet
is
run
around
the
lower
deck
tri
to
find
someon
to
help
free
dicaprio
from
the
handcuff
as
she
frantic
search
up
and
down
the
long
white
corridor
the
3d
ad
a
whole
new
layer
becaus
the
tight
corridor
made
me
feel
her
claustrophobia
and
desper
trust
me
you
will
be
blown
away
when
you
final
see
thi
again
in
3d
anyway
shortli
after

if

just
becaus
someon

titan
in

is
akin
to
a

of
a

piec

i

believ
titan
is
a

sturdi
enough
film
to

thi
kind
of

it
s
a

again
like
it

i
d

thi

if
there
wa

some

a

for

higher

realli
add

the

that
s

it
i
give
cameron
credit
he
s
determin
to
make
the
world
understand
how
3d
is
the
way
of
futur
but
the
implement
thu
far
is
rel
underwhelm
in
most
circumst

i
agre
the
way
i

it
is
that
although
titan
isn

my

favourit
film
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
film
ever
made
and
i

jim
cameron
s

titan
is

it
or
not
one
of
the
most
incred
film
to
be
releas
in
the
past
25
30
year
asid
from
pulp
fiction
i
can
t
think
of
anoth
film
that
ha
impact
film
and
pop
cultur
more
significantli
and
i
m
a
32
year
old
film
fan
i
rememb
in
the
month
lead
up
to
the
releas
in
97
everyon
wa
trip
over
themselv
in
a
hurri
to
call
it
a
failur
14
year
and
the
biggest
box
offic
gross
in
histori
later
those
same
peopl
are
still
tri
to
convinc
peopl
it
isn
t
good
whoop
what
kill
me
is
that
peopl
like
to
s
t
all
over
thi
movi
by
refer
to
it
as
a
chick
flick
yeah
a
hot
piec

like
kate
winslet
get
nake
in
a
pg
13
movi
and
hundr
of
peopl
be
brutal
kill
on

is
total
chick
flick
territori
it
s
a
histor
epic
with
an
emot
engag
stori
and
still
to
thi
day
incred
special

or
as
i
like
to
call
it
just
a
damn
good
film
i
don

know
whi
peopl
get
all
bent
out
of
shape
about
cameron
or
seem
to
lose
all
sort
of
clariti
or
saniti
when
discuss
hi
last
two
film
but
i
think
it
may
be
some
sort
of
weird
fanboy
backlash
he
made
alien
and
the
termin
film
and
everyon
seem
to
agre
those
are
fantast
but
becaus
someth

wildli

way
mean
your

your

all
agre
titan
wa
awesom
now
the

ha

turn
up

nose
it
s
possibl
that
becaus
of
cameron
s
brash
persona
he
come
off
as
arrog

when
you
make
the
top
2
highest

of

overal
melimoo
serious
titan
is
an
amaz
film
in
2d
or
3d
so
whoever
think
otherwis
is
just
delussion
it
wa
a
real
life
event
that
nobodi
in
thi
gener
will
have
seen
or
known
about

slight
detail
without
that
film
yeah
it
wasnt
the
real
thing
but
i
doubt
that
anyon
would
want
to
see
the
real
thing
consid
that
it
wa
heartbreak
and
a
lot
of
peopl
die
becaus
of
their
class
it
show
how
peopl
were
treat
accord
to
their
class
and
also
about
other
thing
serious
i
think
that
film
is
amaz
and
it
is
my
favourit
film
jame
cameron
is
truli
amaz
for
creat
titan
and
make
it
so
realist
and
all
thi
is
come
from
a
16
year
old
girl
whoever
think
bad
of
jame
cameron
then
serious
get
a
grip
he
make
good
film
and
satisfi
a
lot
of
peopl
with
the
film
he
make
if
you
dont
like
jame
cameron
or
the
film
he
make
or
even
the
amount
of
money
he
make
out
of
make
them
then
dont
watch
them
and
stop
critis
what
he
doe
when
a
lot
of
peopl
love
what
he
doe
and
what
he
creat
he
goe
to
a
great
deal
of
troubl
to
make
them
in
such
detail
like
he
did
with
titan
and
if
you
dont
like
it
then
like
i
said
don
t
watch
it
pingback
