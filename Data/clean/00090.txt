made
me
a

i
rememb
at
my
vast
old
age
in
7th
grade
sadli
conclud
that
i
wa
too
old
for
the
narnia
book
now
i
had
alreadi
read
them
mani
time
then
i
took
them
up
again
in
colleg
and
found
new
rich
i
know
i
will
never
outgrow
them
again
no
kid
who
read
thi
book
will
ever
look
at
a
closet
door
the
same
way
again
sondra

the
first
seri
i
read
to
myself
start
halfway
through
when
i
switch
from
listen
to
my
mom
read
them
aloud
to
sneak
them
off
to
my
room
to
read
ahead
i
wa
convinc
that
someday
i
would
meet
the
pevensi
and
tell
them
that
i
knew
about
narnia
too
sadli

not

lay
on
my

on
a

i
finish
it
and
read
it
again
and
again
i
don

alway
think
the
oldest
most
classic
version
of
a
tale
is
the
one
that
kid
should
keep
rend
if
someon
els
come
along

me
when
publish

of
when
the

bud
with

perhap
bud
is
not

he
found
the
