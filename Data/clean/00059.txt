the

it

believ
whatev
the

might

for

there
wa

he
wa
much
the

as
at

at

nine
they

there
were
some
that

thi

a
veri
nice
well
spoken
gentlehobbit
is
mr
bilbo
as
i
ve
alway
said
the
gaffer
declar
with
perfect
truth
for
bilbo
wa
veri
polit
to
him
call
him
master
hamfast
and
consult
him
constantli
upon
the
grow
of
veget
in
the
matter
of
root
especi
potato
the
gaffer
wa
recogn
as
the
lead
author
by
all
in
the
neighbourhood
includ
himself
but
what
about
thi
frodo
that
live
with
him
ask
old
noak
of
bywat
baggin
is
hi
name
but
he
s
more
than
half
a
brandybuck
they
say
it
beat
me
whi
ani
baggin
of
hobbiton
should
go
look
for
a
wife
away
there
in
buckland
where
folk
are
so
queer
and
no
wonder
they
re
queer
put
in
daddi
twofoot
the
gaffer
s
next
door
neighbour
if
they
live
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
brandywin
river
and
right
agin
the
old
forest
that
s
a
dark
bad
place
if
half
the
tale
be
true
you
re
right
dad
said
the
gaffer
not
that
the
brandybuck
of
buckland
live
in
the
old
forest
but
they
re
a
queer
breed
seemingli
they
fool
about
with
boat
on
that
big
river
and
that
isn
t
natur
small
wonder
that
troubl
came
of
it
i
say
but
be
that
as
it
may
mr
frodo
is
as
nice
a
young
hobbit
as
you
could
wish
to
meet
veri
much
like
mr
bilbo
and
in
more
than
look
after
all
hi
father
wa
a
baggin
a
decent
respect
hobbit
wa
mr
drogo
baggin
there
wa
never
much
to
tell
of
him
till
he
wa
drownd
drownd
said
sever
voic
they
had
heard
thi
and
other
darker
rumour
befor
of
cours
but
hobbit
have
a
passion
for
famili
histori
and
they
were
readi
to
hear
it
again
well
so
they
say
said
the
gaffer
you
see
mr
drogo
he
marri
poor
miss
primula
brandybuck
she
wa
our
mr
bilbo
s
first
cousin
on
the
mother
s
side
her
mother
be
the
youngest
of
the
old
took
s
daughter
and
mr
drogo
wa
hi
second
cousin
so
mr
frodo
is
hi
first
and
second
cousin
onc
remov
either
way
as
the
say
is
if
you
follow
me
and
mr
drogo
wa
stay
at
brandi
hall
with
hi
father
in
law
old
master
gorbadoc
as
he
often
did
after
hi
marriag
him
be
partial
to
hi
vittl
and
old
gorbadoc
keep
a
mighti
gener
tabl
and
he
went
out
boat
on
the
brandywin
river
and
he
and
hi
wife
were
drownd
and
poor
mr
frodo
onli
a
child
and
all
i
ve
heard
they
went
on
the
water
after
dinner
in
the
moonlight
said
old
noak
and
it
wa
drogo
s
weight
as
sunk
the
boat
and
i
heard
she
push
him
in
and
he
pull
her
in
after
him
said
sandyman
the
hobbiton
miller
you
shouldn
t
listen
to
all
you
hear
sandyman
said
the
gaffer
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
there
isn
t
no
call
to
go
talk
of
push
and
pull
boat
are
quit
tricki
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
look
further
for
the
caus
of
troubl
anyway
there
wa
thi
mr
frodo
left
an
orphan
and
strand
as
you
might
say
among
those
queer
buckland
be
brought
up
anyhow
in
brandi
hall
a
regular
warren
by
all
account
old
master
gorbadoc
never
had
fewer
than
a
coupl
of
hundr
relat
in
the
place
mr
bilbo
never
did
a
kinder
deed
than
when
he
brought
the
lad
back
to
live
among
decent
folk
but
i
reckon
it
wa
a
nasti
shock
for
those
sackvil
baggins
they
thought
they
were
go
to
get
bag
end
that
time
when
he
went
off
and
wa
thought
to
be
dead
and
then
he
come
back
and
order
them
off
and
he
goe
on
live
and
live
and
never
look
a
day
older
bless
him
and
suddenli
he
produc
an
heir
and
ha
all
the
paper
made
out
proper
the
sackvil
baggins
won
t
never
see
the
insid
of
bag
end
now
or
it
is
to
be
hope
not
there
s
a
tidi
bit
of
money
tuck
away
up
there
i
hear
tell
said
a
stranger
a
visitor
on
busi
from
michel
delv
in
the
westfarth
all
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnel
pack
with
chest
of
gold
and
silver
and
jool
by
what
i
ve
heard
then
you
ve
heard
more
than
i
can
speak
to
answer
the
gaffer
i
know
noth
about
jool
mr
bilbo
is
free
with
hi
money
and
there
seem
no
lack
of
it
but
i
know
of
no
tunnel
make
i
saw
mr
bilbo
when
he
came
back
a
matter
of
sixti
year
ago
when
i
wa
a
lad
i
d
not
long
come
prentic
to
old
holman
him
be
my
dad
s
cousin
but
he
had
me
up
at
bag
end
help
him
to
keep
folk
from
trampl
and
trapess
all
over
the
garden
while
the
sale
wa
on
and
in
the
middl
of
it
all
mr
bilbo
come
up
the
hill
with
a
poni
and
some
mighti
big
bag
and
a
coupl
of
chest
i
don
t
doubt
they
were
mostli
full
of
treasur
he
had
pick
up
in
foreign
part
where
there
be
mountain
of
gold
they
say
but
there
wasn
t
enough
to
fill
tunnel
but
my
lad
sam
will
know
more
about
that
he
s
in
and
out
of
bag
end
crazi
about
stori
of
the
old
day
he
is
and
he
listen
to
all
mr
bilbo
s
tale
mr
bilbo
ha
learn
him
hi
letter
mean
no
harm
mark
you
and
i
hope
no
harm
will
come
of
it
elv
and
dragon
i
say
to
him
cabbag
and
potato
are
better
for
me
and
you
don
t
go
get
mix
up
in
the
busi
of
your
better
or
you
ll
land
in
troubl
too
big
for
you
i
say
to
him
and
i
might
say
it
to
other
he
ad
with
a
look
at
the
stranger
and
the
miller
but
the
gaffer
did
not
convinc
hi
audienc
the
legend
of
bilbo
s
wealth
wa
now
too
firmli
fix
in
the
mind
of
the
younger
gener
of
hobbit
ah
but
he
ha
like
enough
been
ad
to
what
he
brought
at
first
argu
the
miller
voic
common
opinion
he
s
often
away
from
home
and
look
at
the
outlandish
folk
that
visit
him
dwarv
come
at
night
and
that
old
wander
conjuror
gandalf
and
all
you
can
say
what
you
like
gaffer
but
bag
end
s
a
queer
place
and
it
folk
are
queerer
and
you
can
say
what
you
like
about
what
you
know
no
more
of
than
you
do
of
boat
mr
sandyman
retort
the
gaffer
dislik
the
miller
even
more
than
usual
if
that
s
be
queer
then
we
could
do
with
a
bit
more
queer
in
these
part
there
s
some
not
far
away
that
wouldn
t
offer
a
pint
of
beer
to
a
friend
if
they
live
in
a
hole
with
golden
wall
but
they
do
thing
proper
at
bag
end
our

that

book
vs

i
recent
complet
a
cours
at
a
commun
colleg
in
california
where
we
review
the
lord
of
the
ring
trilog
the
hobbit
and
the
movi
all
four
movi
if
you
count
the
anim
hobbit
film
as
a
movi
which
i
do
onli
begrudgingli
thi
post
is
the
final
assign
in
the
class
we
learn
a
bit
about
the
author
in
the
class
and
i
have
more
respect
for
tolkien
now
what
i
didn
t
know
befor
wa
that
tolkien
had
alreadi
creat
middl
earth
in
hi
mind
unlik
mani
modern
fantasi
writer
who
seem
to
just
throw
togeth
a
gener
map
and
give
it
some
crazi
name
in
tolkien
s
work
there
is
a
sens
that
the
world
is
much
older
than
the
stori
he
is
tell
it
is
less
so
with
other
writer
who
sometim
creat
two
or
more
world
which
seem
onli
as
a
place
for
the
stori
to
take
place
middl
earth
ha
a
qualiti
that
make
it
more
than
that
it
s
almost
a
charact
rather
than
a
locat
my
first
exposur
to
tolkien
wa
in
anticip
of
the
first
movi
in
2000
i
read
the
first
book
befor
the
first
movi
came
out
then
complet
the
other
two
book
befor
the
second
movi
came
out
i
also
read
the
hobbit
at
some
point
i
enjoy
the
movi
enough
that
i
onli
watch
them
a
coupl
of
time
so
as
to
preserv
the
enchant
i
wa
a
young
teenag
when
i
first
read
the
book
and
i
wa
too
young
to
appreci
the
good
write
at
the
time
i
prefer
the
movi
over
the
book
becaus
i
found
the
name
and
locat
to
be
difficult
to
distinguish
in
read
but
easi
to
visual
with
the
movi
have
taken
thi
cours
i
now
have
a
revers
opinion
of
the
book
and
movi
i
believ
the
movi
are
as
good
as
can
be
done
but
the
literari
work
is
much
better
howev
i
am
not
a
purist
when
it
come
to
movi
vs
book
read
and
watch
lord
of
the
ring
in
conjunct
with
each
other
wa
a
great
experi
becaus
it
gave
two
point
of
view
of
the
same
stori
i
would
recommend
that
everyon
with
an
interest
in
the
seri
compar
the
two
it
is
pretti
well
accept
that
movi
rendit
are
never
as
good
as
the
book
they
are
base
on
and
out
of
necess
there
are
thing
alter
to
fit
budget
and
time
restraint
but
if
you
can
take
those
fact
as
read
there
are
some
interest
comparison
that
can
be
made
between
the
two
media
sourc
for
exampl
the
charact
faramir
is
complet
differ
in
the
movi
some
peopl
are
content
to
say
that
the
movi
ruin
faramir
but
get
past
the
differ
help
to
get
a
new
view
of
the
charact
i
use
thi
practic
with
ani
appar
discrep
between
the
book
and
movi
after
rant
about
how
they
mess
up
in
the
movi
i
took
an
object
view
and
it
help
me
to
valu
both
work

great
new
releas
of
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
novel
of
all
time
thi
hardcov
one
volum
edit
of
lord
of
the
ring
wa
releas
for
the
50th
anniversari
of
it
public
1954
over
the
year
numer
correct
in
the
spell
of
certain
word
by
well
intent
publish
and
printer
led
to
some
confus
among
reader
they
weren
t
realli
seriou
mistak
but
some
reader
were
left
confus
by
the
lack
of
consist
in
the
text
they
never
realli
took
away
from
the
beauti
of
the
novel
but
tolkien
wa
constantli
frustrat
by
these
constantli
reoccur
error
thi
is
suppos
to
be
the
definit
edit
with
all
mistak
correct
without
alter
anyth
signific
in
the
text
or
realli
chang
what
the
author
himself
wrote
it
s
print
on
good
glossyish
paper
and
the
type
is
easi
to
read
i
ve
carri
the
book
around
for
a
while
and
it
isn
t
fall
apart
at
the
seam
it
seem
to
be
bound
well
enough
to
last
a
while
the
onli
shortcom
that
thi
edit
of
the
lord
of
the
ring
ha
in
my
opinion
is
the
lack
of
fold
out
map
that
appear
in
the
collector
edit
and
the
three
volum
edit
of
the
novel
and
that
is
what
it
is
a
novel
and
not
a
trilog
instead
it
show
four
differ
map
as
if
the
origin
map
of
middl
earth
were
divid
into
quarter
at
the
center
but
they
overlap
for
conveni
it
s
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
think
for
the
price
the
publish
realli
could
have
includ
a
fold
out
map
or
two
but
that
s
the
onli
drawback
whatsoev
and
hi
origin
map
of
the
shire
at
the
begin
of
book
one
is
still
there
intact
as
for
the
novel
itself
what
a
great
epic
tale
i
realli
onli
want
thi
review
to
explain
the
new
edit
and
what
make
it
good
sinc
so
mani
alreadi
know
the
stori
behind
the
lord
of
the
ring
the
movi
to
get
off
topic
for
a
moment
were
actual
pretti
faith
to
the
book
in
mani
respect
but
even
if
you
ve
seen
the
movi
you
haven
t
seen
nothin
yet
until
you
have
read
the
book
which
is
quit
often
the
case
with
great
novel
that
get
made
into
movi
my
favorit
charact
is
sam
frodo
s
faith
companion
while
book
one
start
out
a
bit
slow
it
pick
up
the
pace
consider
in
book
two
and
realli
get
into
the
action
ye
it
s
long
but
it
s
as
just
about
as
long
as
it
need
to
be
thi
hardcov
edit
is
well
worth
the
price
and
more
conveni
to
read
than
a
three
volum
edit
where
you
d
have
to
keep
flip
from
one
volum
to
the
next
if
you
were
to
refer
to
the
index
or
appendic
that
follow
volum
three
i
recommend
get
thi
50th
anniversari
hardcov
edit
or
at
a
lesser
cost
the
paperback
version
of
it
i
do
not
regret
a
singl
penni
i
paid
for
it
