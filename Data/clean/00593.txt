copi

song
i

album

dure
the
entireti
of
the
trip
whi
becaus
queen
s
music
wa
unlik
anyth
i
d
heard
up
to
that
point
i
wa
listen
to
band
like
journey
and
foreign
at
the
time
so
while
i
wa
alreadi
take
piano
lesson
dure
thi
time
my
knowledg
of
more
eclect
form
of
rock
music
wa
incred
limit
suddenli
the
a
cappella
vocal
and
stomp
clap
combo
of
we
will
rock
you
burst
through
the
headphon
and
i
wa
hook
the
bombast
the
genr
bend
varieti
and
an
endless
bounti
of
charisma
thi
band
display
quickli
convert
me
and
influenc
much
of
my
music
journey
from
then
on
out
thi
wa
my
big
foray
into
metal
progress
rock
music
hall
ragtim
and
numer
other
genr
mani
not
even
normal
associ
with
rock
in
the
first
place
while
journey
wa
the
first
band
i
got
into
queen
were
truli
ground
zero
for
where
i
d
eventu
head
with
thi
art
form
that
s
whi
it
wa
so
fun
to
return
to
the
group
for
my
discographi
review
on
thi
site
i
wa
listen
to
what
eventu
brought
me
to
a
websit
like
thi
in
the
first
place
it
gave
me
the
genuin
passion
and
drive
to
listen
to
more
music
and
expand
my
palett
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
in
mani
case
nostalgia
tend
to
alter
peopl
view
on
certain
artist
good
or
bad
which
is
whi
an
object
retrospect
view
can
be
realli
tough
to
convey
just
look
at
my
old
journey
write
up
and
opinion
on
here
for
a
solid
exampl
in
which
i
wa
hand
out
numer
4s
for
the
group
primarili
becaus
of
my
fond
memori
of
their
work
i
wa
blind
in
a
sens
by
my
fandom
and
didn
t
give
some
of
those
record
their
due
critic
howev
queen
remain
one
of
the
onli
case
in
which
i
love
them
just
as
much
now
as
i
did
back
then
freddi
s
vocal
vari
charismat
and
power
the
guitar
work
by
brian
may
precis
passion
and
tast
the
rhythm
work
by
john
deacon
and
roger
taylor
a
great
way
to
reliabl
anchor
the
other
member
while
take
on
a
life
and
person
of
it
own
in
queen
everyon
matter
just
like
in
the
beatl
each
member
wa
absolut
integr
to
the
signatur
queen
experi
thing
wouldn
t
have
felt
the
same
without
each
member
s
music
person
shine
through
at
differ
moment
whether
it
be
john
deacon
s
bass
run
in
song
like
millionair
waltz
or
you
re
my
best
friend
or
roger
taylor
s
hard
rock
aggress
display
in
hi
composit
or
the
intim
chemistri
between
freddi
and
brian
s
role
and
collabor
work
the
band
kick
the
most
ass
when
work
as
a
full
and
cohes
unit
and
unfortun
that
s
whi
the
80
weren
t
the
kindest
decad
to
the
band
even
as
a
huge
fan
it
s
tough
to
recommend
album
like
the
work
or
flash
gordon
to
anyon
but
the
most
hardcor
queen
diehard
becaus
of
how
separ
the
band
member
sound
and
how
rehash
thing
were
start
to
sound
while
they
d
ultim
recov
with
a
bang
dure
the
late
80
and
earli
90
befor
freddi
s
tragic
death
it
s
a
bit
unfortun
to
know
that
there
are
some
weak
black
sheep
among
the
band
s
impress
catalog
regardless
the
band
s
best
aspect
are
enough
to
triumph
over
the
darker
time
of
their
career
besid
when
ha
a
realli
lengthi
career
ever
stay
consist
fantast
queen
s
classic
record
remain
amaz
to
thi
day
everyth
from
1973
to
1980
be
complet
worthi
of
a
recommend
the
way
the
group
would
fluidli
combin
such
a
multitud
of
genr
and
still
craft
their
own
distinct
sound
is
just
crazi
and
it
show
when
you
hear
just
how
mani
band
are
tri
to
imit
their
sound
to
thi
day
rememb
when
muse
wa
tri
to
be
queen
with
unit
state
of
eurasia
how
about
when
fall
out
boy
wa
attempt
their
bombast
style
and
harmon
vocal
melodi
with
my
song
know
what
you
did
in
the
dark
just
last
year
rememb
how
mani
band
absolut
fail
at
tri
to
be
queen
becaus
of
how
forc
their
attempt
sound
that
s
becaus
queen
s
style
is
so
distinct
that
they
were
clearli
pull
it
off
in
the
most
natur
way
plu
of
cours
there
s
freddi
mercuri
s
stage
presenc
someth
that
peopl
like
matt
bellami
and
patrick
stump
can
most
like
never
achiev
in
their
entir
career
but
enough
of
compar
appl
and
orang
here
so
let
me
wrap
thi
up
if
you
haven
t
listen
to
queen
or
have
onli
listen
to
their
singl
i
urg
you

dig
deeper
some
of
classic
rock
and
progress
rock
s
best
tune

in
the
band

earli
70
work
and
even
in
some
later
work
such
as
innuendo
as
well
they
had
their
fault
and
failur
but
remain
one
of
rock
s
all
time
great
the
music
is
well
compos
complex
charismat
dynam
