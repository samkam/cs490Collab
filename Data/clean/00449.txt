regard
the

mostli
becaus
i
couldn

believ
soni
would
be
serious
consid
pull
the
plug
you
can
t
deni
that
they
should

it
s
not

with

over

ha
to
have
turn

profit
mayb
it
s
becaus
i
m
a
littl
older
than
your
averag
comment
but
it
blow
my
mind
that
when
a
movi
make
that
much
money
it
can
still
be
consid
a
disappoint
of
cours
it
didn
t
help
that
the
final
product
wasn

that
great
but
i
don
t
think
the
blame
fall
sole
on
the
filmmak
the
market
wa
aw
by
the
time
the
movi
wa
releas
it
felt

there
wa
noth
left

i
understand
tri
to
reach

you
couldn

avoid

unless
you
cut
yourself
off

i
live

there

never

by

you
almost
want

not

it
just
as
an
f
you
to
soni
as
for

itself
i
think
a
shakeup
need
to
happen
on
the
creativ
side
i
think
marc
webb
is
a
decent
director
but
after
2

it
seem
clear
imo
that
he
s
just
not
the
big
budget
type
you
should
leav

feel

that
just
didn

happen
