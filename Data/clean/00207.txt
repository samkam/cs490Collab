is
a
testament
to
a
great
thriller
writer
thi
success
start
from
a
great
high
concept
and
then
build
on

the

is
stun
on
a
first

the
issu
there
are
two
main
problem
that
jack

overcam
the
first
problem
is
that
as
with
the
day
of
the
jackal
we
know
the
end
befor
we
start
winston
churchil
wa
not
kidnap
by
the
german
dure
world
war
two
so
steiner
must
fail
it
s
just
a
question
of
how
second
the
reader
is
be
ask
to
accept
a
nazi
soldier
and
an
ira
terrorist
as
sympathet
protagonist
in

solv
the
problem
by
make
the
stori
into
a
howdunit
the
vital
key
that
jack
higgin
use
to
solv
these
issu
wa
to
make
the
vari
cast
of
charact
vivid
and
sympathet
make
difficult
charact
sympathet
higgin
get
around
the
problem
of
make
the
protagonist
sympathet
in
two
clever
way
first
higgin
ha
an
eye
for
charact
in
a
way
that
alistair
maclean
for
exampl
never
had
he
use
that
skill
to
make
steiner
and
devlin
as
sympathet
as
possibl
to
the
reader
in
fact
to
a
modern
eye
he
potenti
even
goe
too
far
as
anti
hero
are
much
more
mainstream
than
they
use
to
be
steiner
and
hi
men
are
profession
soldier
not
nazi
they
are
in
a
penal
unit
after
attempt
to
stop
an
ss
unit
kill
a
jewish
girl
steiner
himself
ha
an
old
fashion
code
of
honour
and
hi
father
is
an
anti
nazi
who
is
imprison
by
the
gestapo
he
also
ha
no
neg
person
characterist
at
all
hi
men
love
him
women
love
him
he
s
thought
charm
and
strong
he
inspir
instant
respect
in
everyon
he
meet
devlin
is
a
more
complex
charact
than
steiner
possibl
becaus
he
is
base
on
a
real
person
frank
ryan
an
ira
man
who
fought
on
the
republican
side
in
spain
wa
captur
and
spent
the
war
in
germani
devlin
is
a
ruthless
ira
terrorist
but
he
s
also
charm
funni
and
full
of
self
doubt
he
fall
for
a
local
girl
and
defend
her
against
a
local
thug
and
would
be
rapist
and
he
outwit
the
unpleas
doubl
cross
black
market
thi
is
a
classic
devic
to
make
an
anti
hero
sympathet
he
s
not
as
bad
as
the
charact
he
s
pit
against
tragedi
as
stori
theorist
from
aristotl
onward
have
said
the
goal
of
tragedi
is
catharsi
the
creation
of
strong
emot
in
the
reader
the
eagl

ha
a
mission
plot
the
prepar
are

as
radl

and
all
the
charact
on
the
team
are
likeabl
thi
build
the
reader
s
empathi
and
involv
in
the
plot
but
they
know
it
must
fail
thi
creat
the
classic
dichotomi
of
tragedi
becaus
of
their
sympathi
the
reader
want
steiner
to
somehow
carri
the
plot
out
or
at
least
surviv
but
feel
the
inevit
approach
creat
an
emot
respons
the
second
element
of
tragedi
is
that
the
charact
s
own
flaw
bring
about
their
demis
steiner
and
hi
men
fail
becaus
they
are
too
nice
if
they
hadn
t
save
the
local
girl
they
would
not
have
been
expos
and
the
mission
might
have
been
a
success
if
they
didn
t
let
the
local
go
they
might
have
escap
in
the
end
steiner
fail
becaus
he
is
not
ruthless
enough
the
eagl
ha
land
ha
all
the
critic
element
of
a
tragedi
that
s
a
big
part
of
it
success
is
the
eagl
ha
land
true
the
eagl
ha
land
open
with
thi
author
s
note
at
precis
one
o
clock
on
the
morn
of
saturday
6
novemb
1943
heinrich
himmler
reichsfuhr
of
the
ss
and
chief
of

polic
receiv
a
simpl
messag
the
eagl

it
meant
that
a
small
forc
of
german
paratroop
were
at
that
moment
safe
in
england
and
pois
to
snatch
the
british
prime
minist
winston
churchil
from
the
norfolk
countri
hous
near
the
sea
where
he
wa
spend
a
quiet
weekend
thi
book
is
an
attempt
to
recreat
the
event
surround
that
astonish
exploit
at
least
fifti
per
cent
of
it
is
document
histor
fact
the
reader
must
decid
for
himself
how
much
of
the
rest
is
a
matter
of
specul
or
fiction
the
novel
is
frame
with
chapter
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
himself
where
he
make
further
claim
about
the
meet
he
s
had
and
the
document
he
s
examin
prove
the
stori
is
true
there
are
also
two
map
of
studley
constabl
the
norfolk
villag
where
most
of
the
stori
take
place
becaus
of
the
authent
some
peopl
are
convinc
the
stori
must
be
true
let
s
just
be
clear
here
the
eagl
ha
land
is
not
a
true
stori
jack
higgin
goe
to
such
length
to
claim
authent
becaus
peopl
are
more
like
to
accept
a
fantast
stori
if
they
think
it
s
true
thi
is
a
common
trait
in
spi
thriller
an
aura
of
authent
help
maintain
the
suspens
of
disbelief
in
fact
there
were
no
german
spi
in
england
dure
world
war
two
they
were
all
pick
up
by
mi5
and
ani
spi
oper
their
transmitt
from
their
bedroom
twice
weekli
would
be
pick
up
in
no
time
so
mr
grey
s
part
of
the
stori
is
pure
fiction
and
would
germani
realli
send
such
a
small
forc
onli
just
over
a
dozen
soldier
similar
british
paratroop
oper
like
the
brunev
raid
consist
of
a
minimum
of
a
compani
over
a
hundr
soldier
the
onli
partial
claim
to
truth
are
the
soviet
claim
to
have
foil
a

stalin
and

at

by

but
after

who
the

without

sutherland
also
look
noth

the
