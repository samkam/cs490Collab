i
can
t
believ
how
mani
star

were
dissapoint
becaus
ep1
didn
t
turn
out
the
way
they
envis
it
star
war
is
georg
luca
babi
who
are
we
to
tell
him
what
come
next
or
who
die
and
who
live
as
for
terri
brook
i
think
he
did
an
excel
job
do
the
adapt
especi
if
you
have
read
the
adapt
for
the
2nd
trilog
ep4
6
you
might
as
well
have
bought
the
screenplay
for
those
novel
sure
there
are
a
few
thing
differ
like
edit
out
the
charact
s
name
next
to
their
line
and
threepio
smile
a
lot
if
you
don
t
know
what
i
mean
read
ep4
by
gl
but
overal
the
book
are
just
script
phantom
menac
devl
into
the
plot
a
lot
better
and
give
us
background
detail
which
better
illumin
statement
made
by
the
charact
like
alway
two
there
is
a
master
and
an
apprentic
the
pod
race
scene
which
is
highlight
in
both
the

hear
that
he
is
stronger
than

who
is
how
strong
it
yet
anoth
to
see
that
strength
in
