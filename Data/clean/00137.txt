to
be
somewher
at

where
you
can
see
a
few
girl
around
onc
in
a
while
even
if
they
re
onli
scratch
their
arm
or

or
someth
old
selma
thurmer

wa
the
headmast
s
daughter
show
up
at

quit
often
but
she
wasn
t
exactli
the
type
that
drove
you
mad
with
desir
she

pretti
nice
girl
though
i

manur
about

more
from
thi
review
i
also
recommend
definit
worth
my
time
i
knew
that
the
catcher
in
the
rye
wa
an
older
book
becaus
my
dad
had
talk
about
how
it
wa
such
a
classic
even
to
my
grandpaw
i
decid
to
buy
it
and
i
finish
it
the
day
it
wa
purchas
i
usual
don
t
read
that
quickli
but
it
wa
veri
good
not
a
lot
actual
happen
within
the
time
it
wa
narrat
by
holden
but
the
best
part
of
the
book
is
how
the
author
is
descript
about
thing
that
deserv
to
be
describ
and
leav
out
the
less
import
thing
which
mani
other
author
fail
to
do
make
their
book
drag
on
one
of
the
few
book
i
ll
rememb
for
a
long
long

simpli
overr
and
i
hate
to
say
it
phoni
i
will
not
lie
i
am
a
literatur
geek
nerd
whatev
i
love
great
write
if
that
sound
like
you
then
do
not
pick
up
catcher
in
the
rye
it
doe
not
come
close
to
a
masterpiec
of
literatur
on
the
other
hand
if
angst
poor
prose
and
even
poorer
idea
theme
are
your
thing
pick
up
catcher
and
you
might
even
love
it
hell
you
might
start
to
live
by
it
and
think
that
everyon
around
is
so
fake
that
you
want
to
shoot
them
up
sorri
j
d
but
if
throw
in
curs
word
into
a
novel
and
write
about
a
teenag
are
great
literari
innov
then
i
am
sorri
to
say
literatur
is
go
downhil
and
it
realli
just
might
be
if
you
have
been
told
thi
is
a
classic
and
that
is
your
reason
for
read
it
you
probabl
shouldn
t
pick
it
up
read
some
real
classic

tale
of
drunken
debaucheri
and
excess

also
contain
veri
littl
symbol
which
would
prove
use
from
a
teacher
standpoint
holden
as
a
person
is
also
veri
neg
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
stori
is
told
in

in
the
book
are
