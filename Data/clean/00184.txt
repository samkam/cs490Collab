loos
end
here
s
a
upturn
junk
drawer
of
thought
for
you
a
few
mini
review
of
media
i
have
consum
late
becaus
i
m
not
inspir
to
write
anyth
extens
right
now
be
warn
the
rambl
probabl
alert
for
thi
entri
is
orang
last
thursday
tracey
and
i
went
to
see
the
al
gore
global
warm
documentari
an
inconveni
truth
i
am
not
an
al
gore
fan
but
for
some
reason
i
have
felt
drawn
to
thi
film
for
sever
week
now
we
final
went
to
see
it
and
we
both
enjoy
it
well
i
suppos
it
s
hard
to
enjoy
a
film
about
the
impend
inciner
of
the
planet
but
it
wa
a
well
done
movi
some
have
call
al
gore
s
global
warm
slideshow
the
best
powerpoint
present
ever
which
would
be
easi
to
quibbl
with
sinc
it
wa
made
in
keynot
not
powerpoint
howev
the
present
wa
veri
interest
to
watch
and
i
wa
surpris
at
how
excel
gore
wa
at
present
thi
materi
if
you
are
interest
in
global
warm
environment
scienc
or
integr
an
oral
present
with
a
slideshow
hello
pastor
reader
i
can
recommend
thi
film
to
you
and
it
probabl
is
one
of
those
film
that
work
better
on
a
big
screen
so
tri
to
catch
it
befor
it
disappear
into
the
ahem
atmospher
earlier
that
day
i
finish
umberto
eco
s
the
name
of
the
rose
it
wa
a
nice
long
slow
read
i
bought
the
book
a
few
year
ago
after
hear
toni
jone
i
think
recommend
it
as
the
great
postmodern
novel
and
i
just
recent
got
around
to
read
it
inde
the
descript
doe
ring
true
especi
at
the
climax
when
logic
theori
enlighten
and
knowledg
are
demolish
in
spectacular
metaphor
fashion
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
name
of
the
rose
enjoy
broad
critic
and
popular
acclaim
not
everyon
would
enjoy
it
for
one
thing
there
s
a
good
deal
of
untransl
latin
person
i
enjoy
tri
to
deciph
it
but
hey
i
m
weird
like
that
also
the
plot
doe
not
move
at
the
pace
of
certain
other
novel
involv
monk
papal
corrupt
and
mysteri
murder
but
it
s
also
much
more
reward
to
read
a
book
like
the
name
of
the
rose
than
one
like
the
da
vinci
code
it
s
a
slow
burn
a
novel
that
held
my
attent
over
the
cours
of
a
few
week
sometim
i
want
to
plow
through
a
book
not
thi
time
it
is
wonder
piec
of
literatur
that
is
still
pretti
access
also
i
pick
up
johnni
cash
s
american
v
a
hundr
highway
which
i
wrote
about
prior
to
it
releas
i
took
advantag
of
circuit
citi
s
tendenc
to
sell
hot
new
titl
at
8
99
which
is
great
for
two
reason
first
it
s
a
fantast
price
and
second
i
have
the
perfect
defens
for
anyon
who
might
critic
me
for
shop
at
an
evil
corpor
instead
of
a
local
own
busi
8
99
is
probabl
about
a
3
4
dollar
loss
for
said
evil
corpor
but
let
s
be
honest
i
went
there
for
the
price
the
album
is
about
what
you
d
expect
from
a
posthum
releas
that
wa
built
around
track
set
down
by
a
die
musician
at
the
end
of
a
hard
live
career
that
is
to
say
it
s
about
what
you
d
expect
if
that
musician
were
johnni
cash
you
can
hear
the
strain
in
hi
voic
at
time
and
it
s
never
as
strong
as
it
wa
in
healthier
day
but
it
s
still
cash
and
in
some
case
thi
onli
add
to
the
despair
of
the
lyric
it
s
hit
and
miss
but
long
time
and
recent
fan
alik
i
am
one
of
the
latter
will
want
to
pick
thi
album
up
after
a
casual
listen
or
two
i
d
say
the
three
best
track
are
gordon
lightfoot
s
if
you
could
read
my
mind
hugh
moffat
s
rose
of
my
heart

napster
they
can
t
give
it
away
via
dare
firebal
from
the
wsj
onlin
a
littl
stori
about
the
failur
of
free
music
subscript
program
to
take
root
on
colleg
campus
well
free
to
the
student
anyway
the
institut
are
pay
for
them
no
doubt
napster
and
the
other
are
hope
that
access
to
the
free
servic
dure
the
colleg
year
will
entic
student
to
pay
for
the
servic
becaus
otherwis
they
ll
lose
all
their
music
upon
graduat
but
the
student
by
and
larg
are
not
take
the
bait
whi
partli
becaus
of
the
other
inher
flaw
of
the
subscript
servic
name
that
they
would
have
to
pay
a
per
song
fee
to
burn
track
to
a
cd
or
to
copi
them
to
a
digit
devic
what
you
don
t
want
free
song
that
you
can
onli
listen
to
while
sit
at
your
comput
whi
not
there
s
also
the
problem
of
compat
write
nick
timirao
the
servic
won
t
run
on
appl
comput
inc
comput
which
are
own
by
19
of
colleg
student
accord
to
a
2006
survey
of
1
200
student
by
the
research
group
student
monitor
in
addit
the
file
won
t
play
on
appl
ipod
which
are
own
by
42
of
colleg
student
accord
to
the
survey
emphasi
mine
becaus
those
number
are
stagger
we
knew
the
ipod
wa
strong
hold
about
a
70
market
share
but
42
of
all
colleg
student
includ
those
who
have
no
digit
player
at
all
that
s
wild
and
for
a
comput
maker
with
a
market
share
of
less
than
5
of
all
comput
owner
hold
19
of
colleg
student
in
your
pocket
must
be
extrem
encourag
news
even
grant
the
fact
that
unlik
with
digit
music
player
colleg
student
probabl
own
comput
at
veri
nearli
a
100
rate
but
even
if
that
19
is
19
of
comput
use
colleg
student
that
bode
well
for
appl
s
futur
market
share
with
real
grown
up
i
ve
never
been
one
to
wish
for
a
high
mac
market
share
though
appl
is
extrem
profit
with
a
low
market
share
and
i
suspect
their
rel
low
product
number
help
them
keep
their
qualiti
as
high
as
it
is
but
that
