i
read
catcher
in
the
rye
again
yesterday
and
i
still
love
it
he
s
so
quick
to
point
out
the
flaw
of
other
and
can
t
recogn
a
singl
flaw
in
himself
he
take
great
admir
in
be
a
liar
and
crazi
at
time
i
also
love
how
he
is
so
impuls
go
off
on

that
have
no
link
to
what
is
go
on
in
the

my
favourit
part
ha
to
be
when
phoeb
ask
him
what
he
would
love
to
do
and
he
struggl
to
come
up
with
one
