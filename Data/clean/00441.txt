the

the
onli
one
who

mr

soni
gave
us
the
perfect

film
year

with

a
great
film
not
just
for
fan
of
the

also
for
gener

audienc
and
critic
strong
write
great

develop
good
act
and
some
fantast
action
scene
made
spider

one
of
the
best
superhero
film
to

and
soni
should
be
prais
for
give
us
that
spider

2
and
x2
i
doubt
both
warner
bro
s
and
paramount
rememb
without
paramount
marvel

would
never
of
got
off
the
ground
in
time
for

to

take
all

of
been
motiv
enough
to
give

film
we
have
now
frankli
after
spider

2
ani
sequel
reboot
ha
been
a
tough
act
to
follow
i
highli
doubt
marvel
will
be
abl
to
top
it
becaus
so
far
marvel
ha
made
2
3
truli
great

bad

clear
lack

develop

last

fox

unlik
a

firmli
believ
that

in

that

i

stori
wa

we
will
never

avi
arad
claim
that

wa
actual
hi
idea
and
not
kevin

i
ve

so
no

the
reason
that

and
the
asm
franchis

screw
up
he
allow
hi
ego
to
come
befor

billi
fcking
hollywood
they
are
so
wrap
up
in
demograph
and
number
they
ve
lost
the
basic
human
element
of

so
fcking
stupid

i

i

just
a

becaus
hey
reboot
sinc
a

of

were
get
reboot
at
that

i
just
thought
ti
wa

of
the

i
absolut
agre

stori
point
peter

in

begin

within
the

overview
of
uncl
ben

i
don

want
some
superspi
conspiraci
nonsens
it
s
the
same
problem
i
have
with
burton
s
batman
take
a
onc
insignific
element
and
tri
to
make
it
someth
more
import
than
it
actual
is
the
second
film
s
parker
mysteri
subplot
wa
complet
pointless
take
time
away
from
electro
who
desper
need
more
focu
and
better
write
i
thought
they
d
portray
him
as
thi
tragic
frail
man
who
had
hi
one
good
thing
in
life
taken
from
him
i
dunno
have
peter
activ
fail
to
save
him
from
becom
electro
or
someth
instead
he
s
an
overli
attach
fanboy
yaaaay
howev
i
disagre
that
garfield
s
spidey
wa
unlik
i
found
him
veri
likabl
stupid
promis
break
asid
serious
who
wrote
that
scene
and
what
were
they
on
or
did
they
just
watch
batman
begin
and
love
that
stupid
train
scene
partli
becaus
garfield
ha
much
more
charisma
than
maguir
whose
peter
i
alway
found
incred
annoy
i
didn
t
get
the
impress
garfield
s
peter
wa
a
nerd
nor
that
he
wa
well
like
he
wa
just
there
and
a
bit
social
awkward
i
find
that
much
more
compel
than
maguir
s
veri
typic
nerdi
peter
i
am
100
with
you
on
the
last
point
though
ams2
while
have
good
element
peter
and
gwen
harri
aunt
may
had
some
bad
element
that
were
obvious
there
to
launch
a
franchis
the
rhino
exist
sole
to
be
in
sinist
six
and
trailer
electro
s

is
forc
to

and
harri
osborn
s

is
told
and
pretti
much
noth
els
is
done
with

and
the

would
ve
been

if

have

and

in

all
i

the

the

dc
kevinjwood
asm

had
a
coupl
of
major
problem
that
the
marvel
and
x
franchis
found
way
to
avoid
and
that
soni
never
even
notic
firstli
when
retel
the
origin
they
decid
that
the
raimi
spiderman
movi
were
bad
and
threw
out
as
much
as
possibl
and
end
up
with
someth
unrecognis
as
they
had
noth
realli
to
replac
it
with
compar
first
class
which
had
a
new
origin
but
set
it
so
much
earlier
that
the
chang
weren
t
as
problemat
if
they
had
simpli
did
asm
with
a
2
min
pre
credit
sequenc
of
ag
get
bit
gain
hi
power
to
reinforc
that
it
wa
the
same
charact
then
they
could
have
ignor
what
didn
t
work
and
kept
what
did
instead
they
start
from
scratch
believ
that
there
target
audienc
wasn
t
still
watch
the
last
origin
the
second
major
problem
wa
that
they
decid
to
come
up
with
origin
charact
and
name
them
after
the
comic
book
villain
so
you
wind
up
with
an
electro
and
rhino
that
differ
so
much
that
all
the
exist
merchandis
an
comic
book
could
never
be
use
for
public
purpos
the
last
movi
that
did
thi
were
the
fantast
four
and
x
men
origin
wolverin
and
both
flop
instead
of
find
a
charact
like
kraven
whose
costum
and
motiv
would
easili
fit
in
without
major
chang
they
appear
to
have
cast
accord
to
oscar
qualif
and
wrote
the
charact
as
part
of
the
one
off
plot
and
the
fact
that
if
you
hadn
t
been
told
in
advanc
i
suspect
few
fan
would
have
recognis
electro
mando44646
garfield
wa
a
less
likabl
spidey
what
maguir
is
one
of
the
worst
actor
in
ani
superhero
movi
garfield
wa
great
if
not
a
perfect
fit
as
peter
sw
the
fastest
way
to
hobbl
your

is
to
pay
more
attent

worth
take
batman
v
superman
anyon
toni
collier
maguir
wa
a
great
peter
parker
but
a
bad
spider
man
garfield
wa
the
opposit
of
that
hector
b
lop
realli
i
don
t
understand
whi
mani
peopl
like
spiderman
2
and
say
it
s
one
of
the
best
movi
in
superhero
time
in
my
opinion
is
the
one
that
start
screw
all
the
franchis
these
on
the
worst
for
me
a
lot
more
than
spiderman
3
it
s
full
of
flaw
1
the
real
villain
were
the
evil
tentacl
as
i
rememeb
doc
oc
is
suppos
to
be
a
mad
and
evil
doctor
not
a
good
guy
who
wa
control
by
the
creepi
tentacl
2
the
scene
with
aunt
may
struggl
with
doc
oc
at
the
builid
is
as
stupid
as
a
transform
sequel
scene
from
michael
bay
3
spiderman
loos
hi
power
becaus
he
wa
depress
it
onli
weakend
so
hard
peter
parker
s
charact
4
the
trio
partner
best
friend
romanc
triangl
relationship
that
wa
develop
between
harri
mari
jane
and
peter
wa
so
disgust
realli
a
romanc
trio
with
the
futur
hobglobin
that
when
i
saw
the
asm
s
movi
i
felt
a
great
sensat
of
relief
and
satisfact
in
that
way
how
they
did
the
gwen
peter
relat
is
far
superior
from
the
first
trilog
simon
austin
i
think
you
misinterpret
they
gave
garfield
prop
for
play
peter
they
re
disconnect
charact
from
actor
and
talk
about
the
charact
here
the
peter
in
raimi
s
film
wa
a
normal
dorki
kid
who
wa
given
a
chanc
at
great
genuin
love
and
care
wa
shown
for
hi
uncl
apart
from
the
obviou
fall
out
hi
aunt
hi
friend
and
mj
he
wa
over
emot
sure
but
the
fact
that
emot
stem
a
lot
of
the
time
from
tri
to
do
good
deed
gave
him
a
likabl
by
comparison
imo
the
spidey
of
asm
film
is
an
cool
dude
wise
crack
cocki
jackass
garfield
is
a
more
likeabl
actor
than
maguir
but
imo
the
charact
he
wa
play
wa
not
larri
oliv
i
still
consid
spider
man
2
the
best
film
base
on
a
marvel
charact
spiderclaw
everyon
is
stupid
movi
fan
who
know
noth
of
the
sourc
and
column
writer
who
know
noth
but
at
least
thi
guy
made
some
good
point
and
realiz
that
thi
is
good
for
everyon
with
marvel
involv
thi
will
give
us
a
chanc
to
see
the
comic
spidey
come
to
life
some
comment
on
here
say
spiderman2
from
raimi
wa
perfect
but
it
wasn
t
it
had
the
same
problem
the
rest
had
they
all
left
out
what
make
spidey
popular
in
comic
hi
mouth
they
hint
at
it
in
the
1st
asm
but
never
realli
got
it
right
hi
mouth
never
stop
he
just
ha
that
comic
banter
go
on
dure
hi
fight
and
doesn
t
stop
until
hi
bad
guy
are
beat
or
have
a
seizur
from
the
inan
banter
as
they
see
it
he
should
keep
us
roll
on
the
floor
and
i
believ
that
marvel
will
see
to
that
adaminoregon
the
mistak
wa
make
the
second
film
a
set
up
for
anoth
film
with
6
villiain
when
will
they
learn
one
villain
a
movi
should
be
enough
the
way
these
second
movi
treat
norman
osborn
made
no
sens
he
is
sm
s
greatest
villain
and
they
show
him
for
one
scene
then
he
die
and
the
way
they
treat
electro
s
power
made
no
sens
but
thank
god
we
didn
t
get
ann
hatheway
as
black
cat
that
would
have
been
hideou
larri
oliv
best
part
of
asm2
wa
peter
and
gwen
it
could
have
been
just
them
and
i
would
have
enjoy
the
film
problem
wa
they
play
the
romanc
stuff
for
real
but
made
the
villain
campi
badli
motiv
moron
harri
osborn
should
have
been
introduc
in
the
first
film
and
becom
the
goblin
in
asm2
as
the
sole
villain
also
andrew
garfield
wa
great
as
spider
man
terribl
as
peter
blame
the
script
for
make
him
selfish
and
whini
avi
raimi
seem
to
have
lost
the
plot
follow
spider
man
2
i
still
believ
alfr
molina
play
the
best
on
screen
villain
in
a
superhero
movi
but
otherwis
i
don
t
see
the
appeal
of
the
origin
trilog
andrew
garfield
and
emma
stone
individu
and
togeth
prove
better
than
tobi
macguir
who
i
love
in
sea
biscuit
but
not
as
peter
parker
and
kirsten
dunst
the
worst
comic
book
movi
femal
charact
ye
more
than
viper
or
x3
jean
spider
man
realli
came
aliv
in
the
webb
movi
with
the
humor
and
romanc
of
the
sourc
on
mark
where
they
fail
wa
less
than
stellar
villain
work
lizard
deserv
the
famili
background
while
electro
need
more
of
peopl
power
against
ridicul
dub
step
soundtrack
and
costum
dane
as
harri
wa
an
excel
choic
but
need
more
breath
room
while
i
m
saliv
at
the
thought
of
a
new
aveng
san
wolvi
i
m
miss
garfield
and
stone
onward
to
the
futur
avi
i
thought
they
captur
the
comic
well
but
the
villain
need
more
depth
and
pace
wa
a
seriou
issu
the
spider
blood
thing
wa
also
someth
i
wasn
t
in
favor
of
dave
mcneill
i
m
with
you
guy
i
love
the
new
ultim
take
on
the
charact
and
i
complet
disagre
with
the
articl
s
author
due
to
the
fact
that
it
wa
alway
lose
uncl
ben
that
made
peter
into
the
hero
we
all
love
not
the
fact
that
he
wa
bulli
at
school
kanak
tripathi
thi
onli
thi
spidey
banter
dave
the
articl
wasn
t
bash
the
actor
it
wa
bash
the
studio
s
take
of
the
charact
peter
parker
if
anyth
the
articl
prais
andrew
garfield
s
act
abil
and
cite
that
the
studio
wast
hi
talent
with
lack
of
foresight
i
thought
the
articl
wa
spot
on
by
say
that
peter
parker
s
stori
is
more
about
grow
up
and
believ
in
yourself
as
oppos
to
be
a
guy
with
super
power
with
immens
daddi
issu
guest
salli
wasn
t
a
great
choic
for
the
role
a
sexi
aunt
may
doesn
t
fit
steven
irizarri
no
he
isnt
robert
stockton
ye
i
agre
i
don
t
blame
garfield
at
all
just
write
i
mean
how
hard
can
it
be
just
stay
true
to
the
comic
it
s
like
these
peopl
didn
t
read
the
book
at
all
just
the
overview
bring
us
the
spider
man
we
want
i
person
enjoy
andrew
as
peter
just
bad
write
and
for
the
love
of
god
bring
us
venom
and
carnag
steven
irizarri
no
it
wasnt
it
wa
poorli
written
and
act
drfurbal
to
be
fair
the
thing
about
peter
lose
hi
power
becaus
of
stress
came
straight
from
the
comic
the
first
sinist
six
stori
to
be
precis
same
with
the
peter
harri
mj
triangl
although
i
think
the
comic
threw
gwen
in
as
well
which
wasn
t
even
present
in
spider
man
2
mj
wa
engag
to
john
jameson
throughout
the
movi
i
do
agre
that
the
amaz
film
handl
the
romanc
much
better
than
the
origin
trilog
avi
i
love
that
they
did
the
gwen
staci
tragedi
storylin
and
peter
isn
t
a
perfect
guy
you
understand
whi
he
would
want
to
be
with
gwen
even
after
the
captain
told
him
not
to
he
struggl
with
it
throughout
the
film
and
paid
for
it
in
the
end
classic
parker
luck
peopl
think
peter
becam
a
hero
just
for
not
stop
uncl
ben
but
i
believ
peter
becam
spider
man
the
day
he
walk
away
from
kill
the
person
who
lost
him
hi
one
true
love
jason
michael
i
doubt
that
the
creativ
reason
cite
in
the
articl
had
much
to
do
with
the
revers
to
marvel
studio
and
that
the
main
reason
is
that
marvel
want
to
integr
their
properti
whi
wouldn
t
they
want
to
be
abl
to
bring
spidey
into
the
aveng
or
ani
other
film
they
choos
it
just
give
them
more
freedom
jeffrey
westhoff
how
soni
lost
it
way
with
spider
man
can
be
sum
up
in
two
word
avi
arad
so
whi
isn
t
he
mention
in
the
articl
lola
mento
santo
andrew
garfield
didn
t
want
to
be
spiderman
anymor
becaus
emma
stone
wasn
t
go
to
be
in
a
third
movi
be
that
she
wa
kill
in
the
movi
plu
andrew
is
31
alreadi
jame
el
puto
i
think
spiderman
will
be
see
next
in
captain
america
becaus
is
too
late
for
him
to
be
in
aveng
2
age
of
ultron
ian
o
hara
i
miss
jk
simmon
as
jj
hope
he
return
in
the
spidey
film
robert
stockton
i
just
don
t
get
how
anyon
can
mess
up
a
movi
base
on
a
comic
book
all
you
have
to
do
is
actual
sit
down
and
read
it
then
pick
a
writer
that
know
how
to
translat
it
to
the
big
screen
but
yet
time
and
time
again
we
see
it
get
mess
up
i
love
andrew
garfield
as
spidey
just
grab
a
coupl
of
writer
that
know
their
stuff
and
plug
them
in
and
make
sure
they
stay
true
to
the
book
give
us
one
villain
not
six
keep
it
simpl
jeez
their
alway
tri
to
do
too
much
and
oversel
us
someth
that
we
don
t
need
to
be
sold
on
swap
actor
again
is
stupid
and
ye
i
agre
garfield
peter
wa
a
littl
arrog
but
that
s
write
not
on
him
and
i
m
cool
with
garfield
peter
be
social
awkward
and
a
loner
than
him
be
a
nerd
or
dork
i
hope
spider
man
get
back
on
track
thi
franchis
deserv
better
and
we
the
fan
deserv
better
give
us
venom
and
carnag
that
ll
be
a
good
start
asm1
wa
realli
good
and
ye
the
write
at
time
lack
and
could
ve
been
better
but
i
m
not
blame
andrew
one
bit
i
person
think
they
should
show
a
group
of
hardcor
spidey
fan
the
final
cut
of
the
movi
befor
releas
it
to
the
big
screen
to
improv
on
it
and
get
them
to
sign
a
gag
order
or
just
a
hardcor
director
that
s
a
hug
spidey
fan
like
raimi
ian
hunter
i
enjoy
all
of
the
film
as
they
all
we
entertain
i
think
sam
raimi
s
film
were
definit
more
faith
to
the
charact
asid
from
a
coupl
inconsist
the
use
of
organ
web
left
out
spidey
s
trademark
struggl
of
run
out
of
web
the
origin
stori
wa
well
told
especi
sinc
they
gave
peter
parker
a
reason
for
hi
arrog
at
the
begin
spider
man
2
remain
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
all
spider
man
movi
to
date
still
with
all
of
the
resourc
avail
they
should
have
been
abl
to
do
it
right
without
as
mani
modif
as
they
made
in
both
version
by
now
the
ship
ha
sail
for
make
much
of
an
impact
with
the
retel
of
hi
origin
see
him
cross
over
with
the
aveng
should
be
cool
if
they
do
it
right
j
p
ducey
i
didn
t
mind
soni
retel
the
origin
but
they
complet
screw
it
up
when
you
chang
the
classic
line
with
great
power
come
great
respons
your
ask
for
troubl
amaz
spider
man
wa
the
worst
spidey
flick
ever
calvinballpro
denni
leari
onli
ever
play
himself
it
s
the
part
where
he
s
been
abl
to
do
it
for
30
year
now
and
get
away
with
it
that
s
so
baffl
calvinballpro
andrew
garfield
play
spider
man
as
if
he
wa
a
bulli
rather
than
a
victim
of
bulli
that
s
a
problem
jay
the
secret
to
keep
the
spider
man
franchis
wa
just
to
make
good
self
contain
film
soni
wa
follow
the
wrong
model
instead
of
follow
the
aveng
and
tri
and
build
a
univers
they
should
just
be
like
the
jame
bond
film
just
keep
make
them
like
what
you
re
audienc
want
get
as
much
as
you
can
out
of
an
actor
and
then
chang
actor
without
a
big
fuss
in
the
film
sidneyspit
mayb
so
but
chang
that
aspect
of
the
stori
wa
the
absolut
worst
script
mistak
in
the
entir
franchis
what
a
great
moment
in
the
comic
transform
into
someth
meaningless
and
forgett
just
sad
that
ani
writer
could
have
made
such
a
stori
decis
jay
are
you
forget
the
scene
where
he
got
bulli
mickael
duncan
i
think
garfield
wa
a
better
spider
man
but
a
terribl
peter
parker
but
it
s
not
hi
fault
when
you
start
by
cast
a
guy
with
male
model
look
that
radiat
a
confid
person
you
ve
complet
miss
the
point
of
the
charact
mickael
duncan
explain
whi
the
amaz
seri
forgot
to
catch
ben
s
killer
then
chad
becaus
by
not
catch
hi
killer
we
get
to
see
spider
man
transit
from
onli
go
out
to
tri
to
get
reveng
on
the
killer
to
go
out
to
hero
for
it
own
sake
mickael
duncan
actual
the
green
goblin
die
in
the
comic
right
after
he
kill
gwen
so
peter
never
had
that
hero
moment
you
are
talk
about
in
the
asm
movi
peter
never
even
caught
ben
s
killer
and
in
my
opinion
it
wa
much
more
tragic
for
peter
to
have
lost
gwen
after
promis
a
die
captain
staci
that
he
would
look
after
her
rather
than
becaus
he
wa
be
selfish
mickael
duncan
i
m
still
tri
figur
out
what
happen
in
part
2
tomax
while
i
didn
t
realli
have
a
problem
with
garfield
i
did
have
a
problem
with
the
script
and
the
retel
and
forc
angl
they
chose
to
take
in
amaz
i
hate
thi
spider
man
he
seem
mean
spirit
and
bent
on
reveng
against
a
world
that
saw
him
as
a
social
outcast
the
same
theme
that
make
most
bad
guy
bad
mickael
duncan
you
mean
creat
a
timelin
for
dozen
of
interconnect
movi
befor
come
up
with
one
that
gener
audienc
agre
is
even
good
is
not
a
good
plan
i
am
shock
shock
i
say
dudley
sf
gardfield
wa
good
as
spider
man
but
he
wa
too
cool
and
hipster
to
be
peter
mickael
duncan
imagin
if
thano
were
to
bring
symbiot
with
him
when
he
invad
earth
mickael
duncan
i
blame
the
cast
director
for
hire
a
male
model
ooz
confid
to
play
a
shi
nerd
mickael
duncan
for
the
record
they
film
that
shwarma
scene
from
the
origin
aveng
after
it
had
alreadi
come
out
oversea
queerjock2
i
agre
with
peter
be
less
likabl
but
the
skater
thing
wa
not
one
of
them
high
school
is
not
like
it
wa
in
the
60
s
where
be
a
nerd
or
outsid
meant
you
wore
sweater
vest
and
thick
coke
bottl
glass
the
fact
that
he
skateboard
and
ha
nice
hair
in
no
way
preclud
him
from
be
bulli
or
not
well
like
travi
the
biggest
problem
with
the
asm
film
and
i
ll
still
take
them
over
the
raimi
trilog
ani
day
of
the
week
is
that
they
tri
to
adapt
classic
spider
man
stori
while
complet
revers
them
at
the
same
time
the
most
onli
interest
thing
about
the
peter
gwen
relationship
wa
that
she
love
peter
and
hate
spider
man
that
dramat
tension
fed
the
stori
and
make
it
particularli
heartbreak
when
she
wa
kill
becaus
not
onli
did
she
die
in
peter
s
arm
she
didn
t
even
know
it
in
contrast
movi
gwen
dive
headfirst
into
a
situat
far
too
danger
for
her
after
repeatedli
be
warn
that
it
s
far
too
danger
for
her
and
the
obviou
happen
as
a
result
i
know
yay
progress
blah
blah
blah
but
it
s
a
far
less
compel
stori
likewis
they
basic
follow
the
same
plot
beat
for
captain
staci
but
come
to
a
complet
differ
conclus
where
staci
tell
peter
to
stay
away
from
gwen
rather
than
to
take
care
of
her
so
the
movi
get
turn
around
ultim
go
to
the
same
place
as
the
comic
but
tri
to
get
there
by
walk
in
the
opposit
direct
dregj
total
agre
he
wa
confid
to
the
point
of
be
slap
abl
and
he
wa
quit
creepi
when
he
smile
he
just
wasn
t
peter
parker
at
all
those
movi
were
just
dumb
rememb
the
scene
when
he
goe
to
lex
corp
oscorp
evil
inc
to
find
out
about
hi
parent
and
instead
find
a
room
with
great
big
danger
look
machin
and
web
everi
where
so
he
think
i
ll
screw
around
in
here
for
a
while
just
becaus
the
plot
demand
it
retributi0n
they
said
they
believ
garfield
is
a
good
enough
actor
that
he
deserv
anoth
shot
and
that
the
stori
itself
is
what
made
hi
peter
parker
seem
that
way
not
garfield
himself
but
the
script
and
stori
retributi0n
in
what
iter
of
spider
man
is
he
not
actual
good
look
though
even
tobi
wa
an
attract
male
mayb
not
as
much
but
still
in
everi
differ
piec
of
spider
man
media
i
have
seen
peter
parker
ha
been
an
attract
guy
but
still
an
outcast
it
s
veri
possibl
to
have
both
you
just
have
to
make
sure
you
find
an
actor
who
can
pull
it
off
i
am
favor
logan
lerman
at
the
moment
i
think
he
can
pull
off
awkward
while
still
be
an
attract
guy
plu
it
also
will
bring
in
more
femal
as
well
who
might
not
normal
be
into
comic
like
some
other
femal
retributi0n
the
one
thing
i
like
about
the
past
two
film
is
the
actual
look
of
spider
man
i
will
never
forget
in
the
origin
trailer
for
the
first
film
spidey
wa
on
the
bridg
with
a
backpack
and
he
wa
stand
in
the
exact
pose
you
often
see
in
the
comic
stori
wise
meh
jay
stand
up
to
bulli
doe
not
make
you
a
bulli
the
differ
between
maguir
spiderman
and
garfield
s
immens
superior
version
i
think
is
highlight
by
the
contrast
in
how
their
charact
handl
see
folk
bulli
in
the
film
the
much
laud
raimi
spiderman
2
for
instanc
ha
imho
the
worst
scene
i
ve
ever
had
the
displeasur
to
sit
through
in
term
of
what
it
turn
the
lead
charact
into
that
moment
where
peter
s
been
lose
hi
power
see
an
old
man
be
beaten
up
and
cowardli
slink
away
without
ever
object
to
it
let
alon
interven
wa
a
sicken
misunderstand
of
the
charact
especi
given
that
thi
is
after
he
d
lost
hi
uncl
ben
from
not
interven
spiderman
s
lost
hi
power
mani
mani
time
in
the
book
and
not
let
it
stop
him
from
go
up
against
super
power
threat
let
alon
some
basic
thug
heck
the
90e
cartoon
had
him
take
on
the
sinist
six
when
he
had
lost
hi
power
ani
normal
decent
person
never
mind
someon
who
s
suppos
to
be
a
heroic
charact
would
have
interven
and
in
amaz
spiderman
we
see
garfield
s
peter
do
just
that
at
the
begin
of
the
film
befor
he
s
even
got
ani
superpow
as
you
have
a
scene
where
he
won
t
let
flash
thompson
bulli
the
other
school
kid
even
if
it
mean
he
s
go
to
get
a
beat
as
well
that
is
peter
parker
garfield
webb
put
the
hero
back
into
the
super
hero
of
spiderman
wherea
it
seem
like
raimi
maguir
s
take
onli
had
him
do
that
if
he
had
power
or
wa
look
to
impress
mari
jane
i
m
realli
go
to
miss
see
my
favourit

pay
attent
the
storylin
they
claim
audienc
weren
t
expos
to
in
the
first
film
were
thing
i
complet
understood
after
watch
it
and
claim
that
andrew
garfield
s
spider
man
is
less
likabl
than
tobi
maguir
s
even
after
spider
man
3
that
s
just
nonsens
the
problem
with
webb
s
amaz
spider
man
film
begin
and
end
with
the
amaz
spider
man
2
which
is
still
a
solid
film
and
didn
t
deserv
the
thrash
it
got
from
some
critic
no
need
to
crap
all
over
andrew
garfield
who
is
still
the
best
spidey
audienc
have
ever
had
jarvi
the
script
for
amaz
spider
man
wa
vastli
superior
to
the
stilt
overli
monologu
y
dreck
that
compris
the
script
for
everi
singl
raimi
spider
man
film
raimi
s
spider
man
2
is
still
a
good
film
but
it
manag
that
feat
despit
the
script
not
becaus
of
it
raimi
s
first
spider
man
film
is
garish
and
corni
for
most
of
it
run
time
and
spider
man
3
is
just
cheesi
and
amateurish
penguintruth
the
problem
wa
that
asm2
much
like
spider
man
3
tri
to
cram
in
too
much
and
accomplish
noth
in
addit
to
just
tri
to
be
differ
for
the
sake
of
be
differ
and
yet
it
wa
a
lot
of
the
same
at
the
same
time
you
know
no
more
origin
just
jump
into
thing
just
a
new
adventur
we
know
how
spider
man
came
to
be
you
can
sum
it
up
in
the
open
credit
it
s
elementari
materi
just
don
t
cram
in
forti
storylin
garfield
wa
fine
as
pete
and
spidey
he
wa
just
in
a
forgett
movi
and
a
terribl
one
he
shouldn
t
be
punish
for
the
writer
an
director
fault
but
at
least
they
made
gwen
staci
into
a
charact
and
not
some
shine
pedest
like
her
comic
book
counterpart
tomchri
agre
one
of
the
most
perplex
imag
of
spider
man
3
wa
the
sight
of
tobey
maguir
s
peter
parker
still
put
around
town
in
hi
mope
hi
head
protect
like
a
good
lil
safeti
consciou
citizen
you
d
thing
a
guy
who
had
a
life
alter
experi
turn
into
a
human
spider
ha
face
death
numer
time
and
spend
hi
day
swing
around
tall
build
in
spandex
would
have
grown
out
of
such
a
nerdi
look
travel
mode
but
not
the
peter
parker
in
sam
raimi
s
univers
who
after
two
amaz
adventur
wa
still
a
man
child
you
re
right
andrew
garfield
s
parker
spider
man
wa
more
confid
and
outwardli
funni
two
good
script
with
no
origin
and
soni
would
have
had
no
problem
kevinjwood
my
point
is
that
the
cartoon
sticker
album
comic
and
merchandis
relat
to
spiderman
all
featur
as
electro
a
white
guy
in
a
green
and
yellow
costum
so
have
a
black
actor
in
a
black
costum
with
glow
blue
skin
meant
that
they
lost
the
opportun
of
audienc
recognit
compar
for
exampl
the
way
that
loki
wear
those
enorm
horn
on
hi
head
which
featur
heavili
in
comic
base
merchandis
so
that
the
charact
wa
recognis
or
the
the
scarecrow
in
the
batman
movi
who
is
the
villain
in
all
3
of
them
who
wear
a
recognis
version
of
hi
costum
so
that
when
you
read
a
comic
or
buy
a
sticker
set
you
know
who
he
is
and
rememb
all
the
problem
with
prepubl
among
fan
when
galactu
wa
chang
from
a
giant
man
in
a
costum
to
a
cloud
back
to
asm2
if
they
had
chang
the
name
to
dick
maxwel
electropuls
it
would
make
no
differ
to
anyth
and
nobodi
would
think
oh
that
just
electro
with
a
differ
name
mile
goodison
fearon
the
problem
with
asm
2
in
particular
wa
1
have
the
movi
focu
on
oscorp
but
no
norman
osborn
at
all
instead
we
get
him
show
up
for
a
few
minut
to
appar
die
and
then
stupidli
made
harri
the
green
goblin
befor
hi
father
i
won
t
even
get
into
how
bad
the
costum
design
wa
on
a
sidenot
we
could
have
seen
how
chri
cooper
s
take
on
osborn
would
have
interact
with
peter
gwen
harri
aunt
may
and
so
on
but
webb
and
soni
blew
a
golden
opportun
to
let
that
happen
and
instead
we
got
emo
goblin
in
harri
s
iter
2
no
jjj
or
the
daili
bugl
as
well
as
that
s
also
an
integr
part
of
the
spider
mytho
they
could
have
spent
less
time
with
twilight
soap
opera
dynam
between
gwen
and
peter
and
found
a
way
to
see
peter
work
at
the
daili
bugl
and
put
up
with
jjj
there
were
other
gripe
but
these
were
the
main
2
i
had
so
far
butters911
you
guy
are
crazi
asm
2
may
not
have
been
perfect
but
it
still
made
over
700
million
worldwid
and
andrew

wa
amaz
as
spidey
he
actual
quip
alex
evan
i
wa
happi
with
salli

i
had
more
of
a
problem
with
martin
sheen
s
uncl
ben
who
gener
seem
to
come
off
as
kind
of
a
dick
there
wa
just
someth
weirdli
abras
about
hi
demeanor
cliff
robertson
s
rest
in
peac
uncl
ben
wa
vastli
superior
to
sheen
s
in
basic
everi
way
joey
johnson
realli
good
articl
except
you
start
the
problem
with
spiderman
4
when
everyon
know
it
wa
spiderman
3
by
a
longshot
also
i
would
argu
that
cast
tobey
macguir
wa
a
huge
mistak
and
kirsten
dunst
wa
unforgiv
marvel
ha
yet
to
make
even
a
small
mistak
cast
where
as
soni
ha
been
clueless
from
the
start
asid
from
molina
jk
simmon
and
mayb
garfield
stone
but
the
aw
write
never
gave
us
a
chanc
to
see
for
sure
frank
doomrid
johansen
i
prefer
andrew
garfield
over
tobi
becaus
he
wa
more
cocki
and
had
more
confid
i
like
my
hero
to
be
confid
and
not
have
teen
angst
issu
i
haven
t
read
much
of
the
comic
but
i
have
watch
some
of
the
90
s
anim
which
is
where
most
of
my
knowledg
of
spider
man
come
from
when
i
watch
the
andrew
spidey
he
wa
much
more
like
what
i
want
especi
when
he
wa
spiderman
with
hi
quick
comment
like
the
scene
in
the
car
with
with
ben
s
killer
that
wa
great
d
basic
the
way
andrew
talk
as
spidey
wa
perfect
and
as
peter
he
wa
great
as
well
i
never
like
the
fumbl
angst
attack
silent
parker
megagearmax
yep
no
way
that
nerdi
tobey
kid
could
actual
be
spider
man
sarcasm
asid
part
of
a
secret
ident
is
the
disguis
aspect
peter
parker
daili
bugl
photog
and
colleg
student
isn
t
the
daredevil
that
spider
man
is
frank
doomrid
johansen
i
haven
t
thought
much
about
who
will
play
spiderman
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
gope
back
to
school
i
like
the
90
s
spider
man
anim
seri
not
the
kiddish
ultim
one
or
whatev
i
like
spiderman
in
the
set
of
the
game
web
of
shadow
but
i
would
prefer
a
more
matur
and
experienc
spiderman
take
on
high
stake
battl
frank
doomrid
johansen
the
ultim
spider
man
cartoon
is
what
i
call
a
screwup
feel
more
like
spider
boy
lol
walt
kovac
spidey
as
a
dick
couldv
work
if
they
had
gone
with
the
ditko
parker
who
at
time
could
be
nasti
while
pretend
to
be
meek
and
mild
but
thi
would
take
an
actual
charact
arc
which
amaz
didnt
have
walt
kovac
but
oversea
gross
dont
count
as
much
as
domest
and
domest
flat
line
with
realli
bad
word
of
mouth
red
vector
i
m
piss
they
re
shift
capt
marvel
black
panther
and
inhuman
off
thier
releas
date
to
shoehorn
spider
man
into
the
mcu
what
if
spider
man
still
under
perform
even
with
marvel
s
product
advic
help
what
if
soni
decid
to
get
uppiti
and
say
that
they
don
t
have
to
take
marvel

advic
a
want
to
go
thier
own
way
after
all
hope
conting
were
built
into
thi
deal
to
cover
these
potenti
problem
walt
kovac
realli
that
whi
spidey
2
wa
a
huge
critic
success
and
amaz
1
wa
not
walt
kovac
but
that
not
spiderman
you
didnt
want
spiderman
so
your
opinion
mean
jack
walt
kovac
if
the
ultim
version
of
parker
is
so
good
whi
did
they
kill
him
off
travi
you
haven
t
read
mani
spider
man
comic
have
you
spider
man
is
a
bulli
he
run
around
town
look
for
a
reason
to
beat
up
peopl
that
are
much
weaker
than
him
stan
himself
wrote
that
thi
is
how
peter
parker
get
hi
kick
travi
maguir
wa
terribl
at
both
garfield
wa
the
better
peter
and
spidey
frank
doomrid
johansen
if
you
are
gonna
pull
that
sort
of
comment
then
i
say
that
the
onli
and
onli
real
spider
man
is
the
first
one
in
the
comic
and
no
reboot
whatsoev
after
that
in
ani
form
is
spiderman
walt
kovac
the
problem
start
with
3
and
that
is
what
made
raimi
walk
away
from
do
4
frank
doomrid
johansen
when
peter
becom
spider
man
he
get
confid
and
if
that
confid
doesn
t
blend
over
into
peter
parker
then
that
would
be
fuck
up
not
that
garfield
didn
t
have
ani
confid
befor
becom
spider
man
but
the
point
is
that
confid
should
not
be
someth
to
hide
like
a
superhero
trait
lol
what
i
have
alway
like
is
that
the
spider
power
chang
everyth
in
peter
s
life
and
chang
him
i
don
t
want
him
to
be
like
clark
kent
in
the
80
s
movi
lol
nephtali
just
maisonet
i
am
spiderman
for
year
i
think
that
where
the
amaz
spider
man
film
failur
wa
in
it
support
cast
what
mean
that
miss
what
peter
parker
peter
parker
and
that
is
troubl
he
ha
in
daili
bugl
and
school
and
all
the
disappoint
he
ha
balanc
act
life
as
peter
parker
and
spiderman
and
sam
raimi
succeed
he
captur
what
meant
to
be
spiderman
and
made
such
a
great
hero
and
wa
not
that
swung
by
and
save
day
but
that
despit
all
the
headach
critic
and
troubl
he
went
through
he
alway
manag
to
do
the
right
thing
and
live
up
to
hi
respons
that
he
promis
hi
uncl
he
wa
go
live
to
so
think
andrew
garfield
wa
a
great
spiderman
and
so
wa
emma
stone
as
gwen
and
rest
actor
great
action
wa
great
the
two
movi
were
great
but
with
out
the
parker
luck
and
power
respons
ingredi
the
movi
stori
is
go
feel
lost
jay
keat
great
take
howev
garfield
s
portray
particularli
hi
accent
in
asm2
wa
terribl
peter
lack
the
angst
that
spider
man
momentarili
wipe
away
webb
should
have
focus
more
on
hi
romant
strength
500
day
rather
than
effect
and
convolut
villain
plot
thread
jay
keat
it
s
ridicul
it
is
ultim
in
name
onli
amaz
friend
held
the
tone
so
much
better
jay
keat
like
total
for
sure
hypestyl
amaz

had
too
mani
villain
and
gwen
didn
t
have
to
die
those
were
my
dealbreak
jonathan
snyder
you
are
not
alon
the
amaz
spider
man
is
my
favorit
spider
man
film
to
date
frank
doomrid
johansen
play
the
amaz
spider
man
2
on
ps3
ps4
avi
i
think
amaz
wasn
t
a
success
becaus
of
two
thing
1
origin
retel
a
sin
everyway
2
no
proper
develop
for
dr
connor
where
wa
hi
famili
otherwis
it
wa
veri
good
if
someon
is
tri
to
equat
am
staci
with
hi
comic
book
counterpart
that
person
ha
never
read
comic
becaus
the
develop
upto
that
point
were
veri
differ
and
ye
the
green
goblin
power
ranger
movi
is
veri
bad
in
hindsight
but
spectacular
at
it
s
time
but
molina
s
ock
is
a
great
perform
i
think
onli
spidey
2
got
the
villain
right
none
of
the
els
have
come
close
though
i
did
wish
dane
dehaan
got
an
entir
film
to
himself
avi
i
think
you
re
mix
up
spidey
and
supe
a
fumbl
alter
ego
wa
the
clark
kent
of
the
bryne
era
peter
hasn
t
been
that
person
sinc
long
ago
and
updat
him
to
more
confid
especi
consid
hi
veri
popular
ultim
counterpart
wa
such
is
not
a
sin
let
go
of
the
past
man
avi
explain
whi
make
sandman
the
killer
made
sens
in
the
origin
trilog
still
by
not
captur
ben
s
killer
peter
s
failur
is
evid
he
should
have
prevent
the
murder
not
play
hero
after
it
it
s
in
line
with
bruce
s
pursuit
of
joe
chill
in
some
iter
where
he
never
caught
him
ofcours
there
is
that
thing
that
the
murder
may
be
black
cat
s
father
but
who
know
now
where
they
intend
to
go
avi
i
hope
you
read
the
dreck
call
ultimatum
numer
popular
charact
like
wolverin
and
co
were
kill
for
shock
valu
peter
actual
got
a
dignifi
send
off
battl
the
goblin
we
ve
seen
peter
die
numer
time
in
the
main
titl
the
other
die
wish
but
becaus
of
statu
quo
he
had
to
return
in
the
main
univers
while
bendi
could
introduc
mile
who
s
a
good
charact
on
hi
own
appar
peter
is
back
with
the
ultim
line
fail
now
some
say
it
start
fail
the
day
peter
wa
kill
off
that
s
how
popular
that
charact
wa
avi
yeah
but
peter
chose
not
to
kill
him
he
die
by
hi
own
hand
and
it
s
never
been
about
reveng
for
peter
it
s
shouldn
t
be
hero
should
be
more
i
think
it
s
also
tragic
that
peter
lost
gwen
after
staci
told
him
to
stay
away
from
her
becaus
even
love
isn
t
enough
sometim
i
think
thi
show
a
transit
as
it
did
in
the
comic
asm
made
him
realiz
the
tragedi
of
not
act
as
a

show
him
the
tragedi
of

both
have
a

is
that
it
hit
too
mani
of
the
same
exact
beat
as
the
first

don
t
believ
me
which
of
the
two
movi
ha
peter
do
a
report
on
a
scientist
he
respect
ask
hi
friend
who
happen
to
know
him
to
introduc

ha
that
scientist
have
an
experi
go
wrong
caus
him
to
get
power
find
out
spiderman
ident
and
end
up
die
which
movi
ha
a
powerless
peter
gain
hi
power
and
have
a
scene
where
he
test
them
out
in
exactli
the
same
way
which
one
ha
a
will
they
wont
they
romanc
plot
with
mari
jane
which
movi
ha
peopl
he
care
about
in
a
citi
of
million
put
in
harm
way
ye
both
and
mani
other
scene
and
plotpoint
not
onli
did
i
hate
spiderman
2
for
that
reason
but
it
made
the
first
one
which
i
like
at
that
point
kind
of
unwatch
for
me
afterward
then
the
third
one
wa
just
plain
bad
tomchri
of
cours
but
peter
parker
is
not
clark
kent
in
the
comic
the
bespectacl
bulli
peter
parker
of
the
earli
steve
dikto
issu
would
grow
into
a
handsom
young

with
some
super
hot

don
t

travi
they
were
flaw
but
fine
i
would
have
like
to
see
a

lizriata
i
m
go
to
put
the
blame
for
all
of
it
squar
on
raimi
whether
it
belong
there
or
not
becaus
it
s
the
internet
and
i
can
do
that
it
wa
pretti
clear
from
spider
man
3
that
everyon
involv
had
becom
far
too
big
for
their
britch
and
servic
ego
rather
than
charact
i
can
imagin
spider
man
4
with
even
more
sob
tobi
more
music
number
and
look
more
like
a
joel
schumach
batman
film
rather
than
a
spider
man
comic
i
credit
raimi
for
give
us
the
first
real
great
film
spider
man
but
i
also
credit
him
with
drive
it
into
the
ground
with
hi
silli
nonsens
veronica
cristina
becaus
it
is
aw
too
angst
for
a
spider
man
movi
tri
too
hard
be
a
dark
knight
movi
veronica
cristina
garfield
have
male
model
look
well
he
is
cute
noth
more
he
is
not
a
cavil
or
hermsworth
i
can
see
garfield
be
a
nerd
easili
mosespa83
i
thought
he
wa
play
bill
hick
hawk
i
thought
asm
wa
excel
much
better
than
the

a
much
need
offer
after

spider

asm
had
a

too
to

differ
enough
from

the
fastest
way
to
hobbl
your
franchis
is
to
pay
more
attent
to
next
step
than
build
a
foundat
to
make
those
step
worth
take
i
disagre
foundat
is
the
first
step
but
you
re
suppos
to
look
forward
to
the
next
step
instead
of
look
at
the
previou
step
brian
first
of
all
i
think
we
all
need
to
get
past
the
idea
that
the
amaz
spider
man
wasn
t
success
the
two
movi
made
close
to
a
billion
dollar
that
s
a
lot
of
million
it
wasn
t
that
far
from
match
the
success
of
captain
america
which
we
would
probabl
all
agre
wa
a
success
that
said
it
had
a
few
problem
i
don
t
agre
that
peter
parker
came
away
as
arrog
i
still
felt
like
he
wa
insecur
garfield
just
show
a
differ
way
that
peopl
mask
insecur
i
do
think
that
in
the
spider
man
costum
he
came
away
a
littl
cocki
but
i
think
spider
man
s
humor
can
come
across
that
way
sometim
i
thought
thi
version
wa
success
becaus
it
show
spider
man
as
someon
who
joke
a
lot
which
maguir
s
never
did
it
also
show
the
intellect
of
garfield
as
he
fiddl
with
hi
web
shooter
throughout
the
seri
i
thought
there
were
too
mani
villain
in
the
sequel
but
if
they
had
just
held
off
on
green
goblin
that
would
have
fix
it
i
love
gwen
staci
there
wa
a
lot
done
well
in
asm
and
not
a
lot
done
poorli
i
am
sad
to
see
garfield
go
but
i
also
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
marvel
studio
mistmast
spider
man
is
gone
he
wa
like
the
best
and
then
boom
the

he
wa
a
