reveal
that
the
film
won
t
be
head
off

as
he
origin
thought
would
be
requir
it
s
go
to
be
a
lot
of
new
imageri
and
a
lot
of
new
environ
and
creatur
across
pandora
we
re
blow
it
out
all
over
the
place
at
first
i
thought
i
wa
go
to
take
it
onto
other
world
as
well
in
the
same
solar
system
but
it
turn
out
not
to
be
necessari
i
mean
the
pandora
that
we
have
imagin
will
be
a
fantasi
land
that
is
go
to
occupi
peopl
for
decad
to
come
the
way
i
see
it
of
cours
most
would
agre
that
it
s
the
stori
that
are
the
wild
card
factor
here
not
so
much
the
expand
worldview
of
pandora
in
these
film
someth
that
cameron
is
all
too
awar
of
inde
in
said
ap
interview
he
also
indic
the
scope
of
the
narr
in
the
new

trilog
will
far
outstrip
that
in

stori
seen
through

we
spread

around
quit
a

more

we
go
forward
it
s
realli
the
stori
of
hi
famili
the
famili
that
he
creat
on

so
think
of
it
as
a

saga
like
the
godfath
plot
detail
on
the
new

trilog
are
tightli
under

we
anticip
some
variat
on
the
settler
vs

of

of

becaus
stephen

just
kind
of
went
off

more
interest
in

as

there
is
no

veri
littl

ha

m
not
sure
if

make
some
better

like
all
their

but
equal
cameron
who
made
titan
which
won
11
oscar
he
also
made
piranha

let
s
not
talk
about
that
i
would
also
add
ridley
scott
to
my
list
if
the
hobbit

keep
gross
billion
3d
is
go
no
where
i
don
t
care
for
itbut
cameron
did
it
right
i
also
think
the
next
avatar
film
will
be
more
succes
cameron

a
great
salesman
