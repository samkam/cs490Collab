i

thi

i
found
it
to
be
a

well
written
stori
and
i
have
zero
complaint
about
the
strength
of
higgin
prose
in
addit
i
think
higgin
did
an
extrem
good
job
of
creat
three
dimension
nuanc
charact
that
came
to
life
and
appear
complet
human
includ
the

but
more
on
that
in

higgin
did
an
fabul

of
construct
a
well

and
i
will
tell
you
see
as
good
as
i
thought
the
novel
wa
on
a
technic
level
i
found
the
stori
itself
fairli
dri
at
the
best
of
time
and
actual
quit
bore
at
the
worst
of
time
now
bore

i
read
that
to
enjoy
myself
and
so
dri
and
bore
becom
tough
hurdl
to
overcom
here
are
my
four
main
gripe
1
one
of
the
reason
higgin
cite
for
the
popular
of
the
book
in
hi
introduct
is
that
it
wa
the
first
time
that
regular
german
soldier
as
distinguish
from
those
within
the
nazi
hierarchi
were
portray
in
fiction
as
human
be
and
not
bloodthirsti
monster
while
the
portray
of
german
soldier
as
regular
peopl
is
certainli
laudabl
i
must
disagre
that
higgin
wa
a
trailblaz
in
thi
area
long
befor
thi
book
wa
evedwritten
the
world
had
been
introduc
to
the
follow
two
loveabl
scamp
and
how
do
you
not
love
klink
and
schultzi
so
sorri
mr
higgin
but
as
far
as
i
am
concern
hogan
and
hi
band
of
hero
beat
you
to
the
punch
as
far
the
human
of
the
german
solid
is
concern
thu
no
point
for
ground
break
cultur
revel
2
the
fact
that
the
final
outcom
of
the
stori
wa
known
at
the
veri
begin
of
the
stori
took
away
much
of
the
suspens
mysteri
for
me
now
thi
is
not
alway
the
case
when
read
about
real
life
event
in
which
the
final
outcom
is
well
known
as
i
have
read
a
lot
of
histor
ficiton
and
real
life
crime
fiction
that
kept
me
at
the
edg
of
my
seat
howev
in
thi
case
the
slow
method
plan
of
the
kidnap
just
never
seem
to
pull
me
in
and
so
i
found
the
stori
veri
slow
move
3
there
were
no
nada
zero
omg
moment
in
the
stori
which
is
a
real
let
down
for
me
as
i
would
have
expect
some
in
a
taut
thriller
of
thi
kind
for
me
omg
moment
are
those
moment
that
rais
goos
bump
on
your
skin
e
g
jack
nicholson
on
the
stand
in
a
few
good
men
or
someth
that
happen
that
make
you
say
no
way
did
that
just
happen
e
g
for
those
that
have
seen
the
blair
witch
project
the
final
scene
made
me
almost
crap
my
pant
basic
they
are
memor
scene
that
stick
to
my
brain
long
after
i
have
forgotten
everyth
els
about
the
book
movi
etc
thi
book
did
not
have
a
singl
moment
that
will
stay
with
me
for
more
than
10
minut
after
i
finish
thi
review
thu
no
point
there
4
final
while
most
of
the
charact
were
well
drawn
there
wasn
t
what
i
would
call
ani
real
standout
memor
charact
thi
is
close
tie
to
3
abov
liam
devlin
the
ira
commando
come
closest
and
is
certainli
a
good
charact
howev
when
i
finish
the
book
i
wasn
t
anxiou
to
pick
up
the
sequel
and
find
out
what
liam
would
do
next
he
just
didn
t
stir
the
curiou
in
me
final
thoughtsso
i
didn
t
love
thi
book
i
thought
it
wa
okay
sometim
when
i
dislik
a
book
that
the
major
of
my
fellow
reader
rate
highli
i
will
either
be
think
to
myself
what
the
hell
were
those
peopl
hop
up
to
rate
thi
dung
pile
so
highli
and
how
can
i
score
me
some
of
that
or
i
ll
be
think
okay
i
m
the
dung
pile
and
must
have
miss
someth
or
bang
my
head
to
hard
as
a
child
becaus
i
seem
to
be
clearli
mistaken
on
thi
one
well
in
thi
case
i
don
t
think
it
s
either
though
my
statu
as
a
dung
pile
is
certainli
open
to
daili
re
interpret
i
complet
understand
how
someon
can
love
thi
book
and
at
the
same
time
am
veri
comfort
with
my
it
wa
just
okay
assess
so
for
all
of
the
abov
reason
i
just
never
found
myself
pull
into
thi
one
there
were
some
part
i
like
and
it
certainli
had
some
moment
but
there
were
not
enough
of
the
goodi
for
me
to
be
abl
to
say
i

we
saw

ye
onli
one

but
what
a
hero
he
made
up
for
all

i
read
found
all
german
to
be
on

board

i
believ
that
kurt

did
lead

outrag
mission
3
charact
portrait
the
writer
did
research
thoroughli
for
almost
all
charact
can
be
found
by
a
simpl
googl
search
read
about
worthi
to
rememb
that
thi
materi
wouldn
t
show
up
becaus
of
what
it
meant
so
detail
are
graini
but
there
what
is
also
stupend
is
that
each
charact
i
mean
each
everyon
of
them
wa
essenti
to
the
plot
what
i
enjoy
most
wa
the
brotherhood
amongst
these
warrior
each
everyon
a
just

unlik
what
we
know
german
to
be
i
felt
sad
everi

as
the
narr
would
reach

i
also
think
that

should
remak
the
movi
the
earlier

review
of

edit
shelv
supsens
and
thriller
wwii
fiction
read
in
2012
i
think
i
ve
read
thi
book
befor
and
seen
the
movi
but
i
read
it
when
i
wa
in
high
school
or
junior
high
long
enough
ago
that
i
d
forgotten
the
detail
if
it
were
written
today
it
would
probabl
have
a
tighter
pov
and
fewer
page
spent
on
the
set
up
still
it
s
an
awesom
book
not
squeaki
clean
pg
13
but
cleaner
than
averag
for
the
market
i
think
what
impress
me
most
about
thi
book
is
the
way
higgin
creat
sympathi
for
so
mani
charact
even
though
most
of
the
charact
are
i
think
i
ve
read
thi
book
befor
and
seen
the
movi
but
i
read
it
when
i
wa
in
high
school
or
junior
high
long
enough
ago
that
i
d
forgotten
the
detail
if
it
were
written
today
it
would
probabl
have
a
tighter
pov
and
fewer
page
spent
on
the
set
up
still
it
s
an
awesom
book
not
squeaki
clean
pg
13
but
cleaner
than
averag
for
the
market
i
think
what
impress
me
most
about
thi
book
is
the
way
higgin
creat
sympathi
for
so

most
of
the
charact
are
tri

higgin
introduc
the
charact
in

way
that
make
me
like
them
and
want
them
to
achiev
their
goal
well
everyon
except
himmler
and
colonel
shafto
the
charact
are
imperfect
but
admir
or
funni
or
brave
and
though
most
of
them
are
fight
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
war
i
understood
their
motiv
and
care
about
what
happen
to
them
