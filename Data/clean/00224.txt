1975
â
i
wa
8
year
old
and
i
live
in
the
middl
of
london
â
i
d
never
seen
a
rabbit
in
real
life
i
thought
they
were
silli
to
be
honest
and
i
certainli
didn
t
care
about
them
â
so
when
my
mum
gave
me
a
book
with
a
rabbit
on
the
cover
i
just
laugh
â
i
m
not
read
that
i
said
â
trust
me
she
repli
â
i
ve
read
it
myself
and
it

brilliant
â
read
the
first

â
if
you
don

like
it
you
can
stop
but
tri
one
page
and
see
for
yourselfâ
so
i
did
â
and
from
that
first
page
i
wa
plung
into
the
world
of
those
rabbit
â
and
their
world
wa
so
much
darker
and
scarier
than
i
d
imagin
â
becaus
everyth
in
it
wa
bigger
than
them
and
it
wa
all
out
to
get
them
â
just
to
surviv
those
rabbit
had
to
be
so
much
braver
and
stronger
than
they
ever
thought
they
could
beâ

terrifi
sometim
it
wa

sometim

i
could
not
