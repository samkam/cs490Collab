one
of

my
opinion
you
ve
seen
thi
stori
a
hundr
time
but
never
like
thi
final
3d
is
what
it
s
suppos
to
be

instrument
at
the
servic
of
the
movi
you
ll
enjoy
the
visual
experi
no

as
for
the
stori
some
of
the
inspir
are
so
huge
and
so
obviou
that
mention
two
or
three
of
them
would
realli
ruin
the
movi
for
you
and
i
m
not
will
to
do
that
lot
of
mystic
and
ecolog
if
you
like
that
stuff
if
you
re
15
or
so
you
ll
have
a
great
time
think
that
it
s
the
first
time
somebodi
make
someth
like
thi
if
you
re
an
experienc
movi
watcher
better
leav
your

bring

of

thi
review

spoiler
let
me
prefac
thi
by
say
i
am
a
huge
jame
cameron
fan
i
think
termin
is
a
masterpiec
of
sci
fi
and
the
singl
best
edit
film
of
all
time
alien
is
easili
the
best
sequel
not
from
the
origin
director
and
i
person
like
it
a
lot
more
than
the
origin
abyss
creat
an
interest
world
and
wa
rack
with
tension
termin
2
is
an
action
tour
de
forc
and
ha
what
i
believ
the
best
sound
edit
design
of
all
time
true
lie
is
goofi
fun
more
poignant
than
most
give
it
credit
for
with
a
boffo
end
and
final
titan
wa
far
better
than
anyon
expect
it
to
be
and
ha
one
of
the
most
believ
romanc
in
a
movi
so
then
there
wa
the
12
year
wait
for
avatar
no
review
word
of
mouth
ticket
price
or
natur
disast
would
keep
me
from
the
midnight
imax
3d
screen
i
went
with
moder
expect
which
the
film
match
exactli
while
thi
kept
me
from
be
disappoint
it
wasn
t
a
good
thing
movi
fan
were
on
edg
becaus
if
avatar
flop
it
ll
mean
the
death
of
creativ
in
a
remak
happi
hollywood
that
s
a
valid
concern
but
the
problem
is
noth
in
avatar
is
creativ
whatsoev
it
is
liter
danc
with
wolv
in
space
right
down
to
have
a
wind
in
hi
hair
charact
as
a
foil
to
the
new

as
the
movi
progress
it
caus
the
worst
of
all
bad
reaction
for
me
as
a
viewer
i
start
think
about
other
thing
then
i
kept
think
well
the
end
battl
is
suppos
to
be
awesom
spoiler
warn
if
for
some
reason
you
can
t
guess
how
thi
movi
end
end
battl
come
and
the
movi
switch
from
be
danc
with
wolv
to
disney
s
atlanti
but
that
s
unfair
sinc
both
of
those
movi
contain
far
far
better

easili
to

the
battl
isn
t
nearli
as
long
as
you
d
expect
and
nowher
near
as
epic
engag
as
the
final
of

of
the
king
final
there
s
a
robo

fight
and
it
is
admittedli
pretti
good
unlik

of
director
these
day
cameron
know
enough
to
pull
the
camera
back
and
let
us
see
the
fight
howev
it
s
an
odd
choic
to
spend
million
on
10
foot
tall
creatur
and
then
rare
even
have
them
in
the
same
frame
as
human
and
of
cours
there
s
the
obligatori
scene
where
charact
are

there
how
much
you
wanna

critter
and
also
tree
which
dwarf
the

build
i
guess
the
onli
notic
problem
with

is
a
lack
of

stori
what
you
see

will
blow
you

all
the
tough
critic
may
come
down
a

on
the
fact
that
despit
be
the
latest
in

technolog
cameron
use
a
veri
old
archetyp
formula
perhap
just
a
bit
too
schemat
there
are
a
few
badli
script
segment
of
dialogu
but
noth
that
make
you
wanna
blow
raspberri
at
the
screen
what
is
most
import
is
the
fact
that
cameron
s
stori
get
the
viewer
involv
and
offer
a
hand
of
memor
and
likabl
charact
to
root
for
and
some
to
root
against
thi
is
the
post
modern
era
and
origin
is
rare
but
if
there
is
ani
technic
progress
to
be
made
in
the
world
of

there
is
one
name
that
dwarf
