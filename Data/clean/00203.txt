by
jack
higgin
the
spoiler
have
land
there
are
a
few
below
we
all
know
that
churchil
wa
never
captur
by
an
elit
german
paratroop
unit
dure
world
war
ii
and
whisk
away
back
to
germani
still
it
s
funni
when
thing
are
present
from
a
certain
view
like
whether
you
re
watch
a
natur
program
from
the
lion
s
or
antelop
s
point
of
view
you
are
right
behind
whichev
side
s
eye
you
see
through
so
it
is
with
the
eagl
ha
land
i
want
those
guy
to
get
churchil
so
bad
it
wouldn
t
have
alter
the
cours
of
the
war
and
these
peopl
know
it
but
just
for
the
novelti
of
it
it
would
have
been
like
a
bond
movi
with
churchil
tie
down
to
some
kind
of
laser
apparatu
and
hitler
glower
over
him
laugh
maniac
they
could
have
trade
wisecrack
but
of
cours
never
happen
the
eagl
ha
land
is
an
enjoy
enough
book
with
well
flesh
out
charact
that
we
care
veri
much
about
from
both
side
the
bookend
are
a
littl
silli
with
higgin
himself
discov
the
secret
german
mission
that
wa
hush
up
from
both
side
after
the
war
i
m
sure
more
than
one
naiv
reader
believ
the
whole
thing
wa
a
true
stori
but
i
m
sure
higgin
realis
that
most
peopl
would
understand
that
nearli
everyon
wa
with
him
in
know
it
wa
pure
fiction
which
includ
the
author
someth
like
the
realiti
base
docufilm
that
are
popular
today
meld
realiti
with
fantasi
there
is
also
a
mountain
of
narr
to
get
through
befor
the
mission
start
some
three
quarter
of
the
book
plan
the
damn
thing
which
we
alreadi
know
is
go
to
fail
but
it
doe
add
tension
and
it
doe
mean
we
invest
an
aw
lot
ourselv
in
the
success
of
what
these
peopl
set
out
to
do
we
know
radl
from
the
abwehr
is
die
and
would
sure
love
it
if
he
find
some
kind
of
peac
in
know
he
pull
it
off
we
know
how
fine
and
honor
steiner
and
devlin
are
and
dammit
they
deserv
it
after
all
the
shit
they
ve
gone
through
of
cours
there
are
the
less
palat
charact
like
himmler
himself
but
their
charact
arc
aren
t
as
tie
in
to
the
success
of
thi
one
mission
as
are
the
other
it
s
been
a
long
time
sinc
i
saw
the
film
the
eagl
ha
land
but
as
my
memori
wa
refresh
i
saw
just
how
faith
the
film
wa
to
the
novel
there
is
a
lot
miss
but
what
is
there
fit
in
neatli
so
much
so
that
see
the
film
after
read
the
book
could
almost
be
an
anticlimax
produc
shorti
after
the
novel
wa
publish
it
cut
a
few
of
the
novel
s
charact
loos
such
as
steiner
s
father
and
the
british
free
corp
asshol
preston
and
of
cours
forgo
the
bookend
but
it
s
director
john
sturg
never
make
it
hi
own
of
cours
jack
higgin
himself
had
a
hand
in
adapt
the
screenplay
as
if
often
the
case
we
also
get
to
see
churchil
shot
at
the
end
of
the
film
i
believ
where
it
s
reveal
that
the
churchil
visit
the
quiet
countri
town
he
s
meant
to
be
nab
from
is
actual
a
doubl
mean
the
mission
would
have
been
a
failur
anyway
it
s
a
doubl
blow
for
those
read
the
book
as
well
even
though
steiner
doesn
t
manag
to
kill
churchil
in
it
it
s
still
reveal
that
thi
churchil
wa
a
doubl
kind
of
make
you
feel
read
the
whole
friggin
book
wa
a
wast
of
time
there
s
anoth
interest
note
to
be
made
here
about
read
a
novel
after
you
ve
seen
the
film
i
couldn
t
for
the
life
of
me
divorc
the
visag
of
michael
cain
from
the
charact
of
kurt
steiner
no
matter
how
much
i
tri
while
read
it
it
s
a
curs
in
a
way
luckili
i
d
forgotten
that
donald
sutherland
play
devlin
or
that
robert
duval
play
radl
i
wa
abl
to
give
them
their
own
uniqu
face
anyway
if
you
re
look
for
a
war
espionag
read
you
could
do
a
lot
wors
same
goe
for
watch
the
film
