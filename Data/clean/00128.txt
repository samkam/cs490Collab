the
catcher
in
the
rye
so
in
my
last
post
i
mention
about
embrac
the
nois
in
my
head
guess
what
i
kinda
luck
out
recent
regard
that
i
ll
tell
you
how
ok
so
my
mba
is
all
done
i
am
back
home
vacat
for
a
month
befor
i
join
the
big
bad
corpor
world
i
decid
to
start
read
the
catcher
in
the
rye
by
j
d
saling
omg
befor
you
read
further
a
caveat
i
am
soo
not
reveal
the
plot
that
s
the
worst
thing
you
can
do
for
the
book
s
potenti
reader
here
is
my
two
cent
on
my
takeaway
from
it
if
you
find
the
gener
direct
interest
you
should
pick
up
your
own
copi
or
els
wiki
it
for
the
plot
will
you
or
better
still
if
you
have
read
the
book
alreadi
figur
if
someon
els
felt
the
same
way
too
so
ok
back
to
omg
if
ever
someon
had
a
constant
voic
in
their
head
thi
unend
monologu
with
themselv
amus
depress
enlighten
omnipres
it
wa
the
protagonist
in
thi
book
thi
dude
name
holden
caulfield
hi
consciou
let
call
it
consciou
for
fun
can
we
hi
consciou
is
fun
depress
but
so
veri
like
our
own
voic
in
the
head
i
fell
in
love
with
it
headsup
though
thi
fellow
find
just
about
everyth
nearli
everyon
quit
depress
phoni
he
realli
love
thi
word
but
hi
thought
process
hi
flashpan
opinion
are
so
captiv
i
read
through
about
40
page
wait
for
the
stori
to
start
not
complain
caus
i
wa
enjoy
the
nois
in
thi
dude
s
head
caus
you
know
i
thought
i
ll
understand
him
better
wa
all
context
build
i
thought
till
i
realiz
hell
it
seem
thi
is
it
thi
perpetu
dialogu
he
is
have
with
himself
is
the
stori
hi
life
hi
observ
on
the
small
the
mundan
hi
loneli
and
hi
continu
rant
is
the
stori
you
know
whi
i
kept
read
caus
i
love
the
rant
i
know
the
rant
i
know
we
kinda
suppress
the
rant
what
with
all
of
us
condit
to
be
with
it
be
all
hunki
dori
posit
all
the
time
in
the
word
of
the
dude
in
the
book
it
goddamn
make
me
wanna
puke
imagin
that
although
i
use
rant
to
describ
hi
soliloquy
i
don
t
mean
to
trivial
it
in
ani
way
thing
is
the
subject
of
hi
outpour
chang
abruptli
make
holden
sound
veri
close
to
be
just
a
regular
whiner
but
if
you
read
with
an
empathet
approach
you
ll
kinda
find
yourself
in
those
sentenc
somewher
we
all
have
experienc
utter
loneli
confus
some
time
or
other
i
think
the
secret
to
enjoy
thi
book
is
to
kinda
say
oh
hol
ol
boy
i
see
what
u
are
talk
about
i
hate
em
bugger
too
which
one
oh
all
of
em
no
one
in
particular
let
s
talk
no
realli
in
fact
there
is
thi
passag
in
the
book
where
holden
talk
about
whi
he
like
hi
fave
author
the
criteria
is
well
when
u
put
down
the
book
you
kinda
want
to
call
the
author
like
he
is
an
ol
buddi
have
a
regular
friendli
convers
i
think
it
made
holden
a
bit
more
likabl
just
for
that
no
idea
whi
honestli
though
i
thought
i
would
be
depress
caus
of
hi
book
weirdli
enough
it
wa
liber
mayb
it
s
a
littl
valid
for
talk
to
myself
shoot
weird
look
to
peopl
everi
now
then
sometim
it
caus
i
don
t
have
my
glass
on
but
that
s
someth
els
altogeth
literari
critic
will
have
differ
opinion
mayb
old
saling
if
he
ever
came
to
know
my
verdict
on
hi
work
