set
to
head

have
a
veri
good
past
he
is
a
realli
loveabl
charact
a
person
with
a
strong
sens
of
right
and
wrong
and
in
fact
he
help
a

which
made
him
get
into
the
bad
book
of
hi
superior
the
reason
whi
steiner
wa
chosen
wa
for
hi
background
half
american
who
grew
up
in
london
which
would
easili
enabl
him
to
pass
through
the
street
of
norfolk
as
a
nativ
to
assist
steiner
and
hi
men
a
former
ira
man
is
summon
by
the
german
liam
devlin
a
danger
man
with
a
veri
shadi
past
and
the
sarcasm
he
maintain
throughout
the
book
is
quit
amaz
thi
book
wa
rather
differ
for
me
person
for
a
fact
that
i
ve
read
some
world
war
ii
novel
with
protagonist
from
the
alli
but
i
had
not
read
a
similar
book
with
a
german
protagonist
the
plot
wa
amaz
with
an
interest
idea
and
extrem
well
narrat
for
a
chang
i
found
some
sort
of
signific
in
a
romant
sub
plot
between
devlin
and
a
local
girl
in
the
norfolk
villag
which
certainli
is
a
rariti
it
also
had
a
good
contrast
devlin
and
steiner
have
total
differ
person
the
former
a
total
merciless
person
with
no
ethic
whatsoev
and
the
latter
a
veri
honour
person
and
highli
consider
toward
hi
enemi
so
far
especi
the
alistair
maclean
novel
the
soldier
of
the
axi
power
were
shown
onli
as
merciless
kill
machin
but
higgin
portray
the
german
soldier
in
a
complet
differ
manner
portray
them
as
normal
human
seem
to
be
a
privileg
thank
to
the
hate
campaign
from
the
winner
of
the
war
i
also
develop
a
sympathi
for
steiner
higgin
success
for
sure
that
is
despit
the
highli
despic
oper
that
he
wa
carri
out
owe
to
the
way
in
which
he
carri
out
hi
mission
i
felt
that
he
didn
t
deserv
to
die
either
in
action
or
at
the
hand
of
hi
own
men
for
fail
hi
mission
and
i
m
sure
that
i
m
not
the
onli
person
who
ha
stumbl
upon
thi
thought
but
on
the
flipsid
i
found
one
and
that
wa
highli
signific
that
is
the
fals
document
with
which
it
began
higgin
found
a
grave
ye
but
not
of
charl
gascoign
but
of
kurt
steiner
and
hi
thirteen
men
kill
in
action
thi
meant
that
whatev
happen
the
reader
know
that
they
re
all
eventu
go
to
die
therebi
remov
the
essenti
element
of
a
thriller
which
is
suspens
in
the
first
few
page
i
had
been
search
for
thi
book
for
a
realli
long
time
two
year
at
least
i
found
everi
other
book
of
higgin
except
thi
one
and
i
even
fail
in
an
onlin
order
with
the
money
eventu
get
refund
final
i
found
a
veri
old
edit
in
a
librari
after
a
realli
long
wait
and
i
ve
got
to
say
thi
it
wa
certainli
worth
the
wait
the
onli
pain
part
of
thi
whole
experi
wa
that
i
had
to
return
the
book
i
d
conclud
my
review
i
wa
in
half
a
mind
to
award
thi
a
nine
but
a
thriller
without
an
element
of
suspens
is
not
someth
that
could
be
ignor
that
pull
my
rate
down
to
eight
rate
