strength
of
all
the
charact
but
nolan
s
real
gritti
style

also
see
the
more
human
side
the
vulner
of
each
of
the

situat
they
are
caught
in

event
to
the
other
without
wast
ani
time
thu
give
you
a
veri
well
pace
movi
that
will
keep
you
engross
from
start
to
finish
it
s
good
to
see
that
equal
screen
time
ha
been
given
to
the
three
main
lead
charact
without
one
overshadow
the
other
but
rather
each
help
the
stori
s
progress
onto
the
act
i
wont
even
bother
comment
on
gari
oldman
morgan
freeman
michael
cain
those
guy
are
master
christian
bale
as
alway
is
great
as
bruce
wayn
aka
the
batman
i
think
in
thi
movi
he
get
a
lot
of
screen
time
as
bruce
that
help
him
display
hi
craft
well
the
weird
bat
voic
is
still
slightli
annoy
distract
but
by
the
third
movi
now
you
just
expect
it
it
s
automat
ignor
for
me
iron
i
wa
wait
to
see
thi
film
more
for
bane
hathaway
s
catwoman
than
batman
himself
so
let
me
get
onto
their
perform
tom
hardi
ha
definit
proven
hi
mettl
befor
with
incept
warrior
but
it
take
a
whole
new
level
of
act
to
be
abl
to
display
the
evil
wrath
intellig
power
arrog
emot
just
through
your
eye
voic
with
the
rest
of
your
face
cover
by
a
cumbersom
mask
thi
guy
manag
it
so
well
that
he
make
it
look
easi
you
see
the
emot
in
hi
eye
you
can
feel
it
in
hi
voic
it
s
also
a
relief
to
be
actual
abl
to
understand
him
clearli
after
all
the
flak
bane
s
voic
got
when
the
first
trailer
wa
releas
sometim
though
hi
voic
sound
almost
unrecogniz
that
it
made
me
wonder
at
time
if
it
wa
realli
hi
now
my
fave
part
catwoman
ann
hathaway
ha
total
kill
it
she
wa
brilliant
i
knew
she
would
be
when
she
wa
first
announc
to
be
play
catwoman
my
onli
qualm
wa
if
she
could
pull
off
the
entir
sexi
persona
but
man
she
nail
the
role
right
from
her
dialogu
deliveri
to
just
the
way
she
move
she
s
simpli
badass
she
s
all
the
thing
you
ever
want
to
see
in
selina
kyle
on
the
silver
screen
her
sexi
her
stealth
her
cun
the
wisecrack
i
love
that
thi
catwoman
isn
t
an
all
out
black
or
white
charact
but
grey
just
like
in
the
comic
hathaway
constantli
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
wa
the
reason
for
my
applaus
exclaim
quit
a
few
time
in
the
movi
till
date
michel
pfeiffer
s
turn
as
the
felin
foe
in
tim
burton
s
batman
return
ha
been
my
all
time
fave
hathaway
s
perform
ha
made
me
have
pfeiffer
share
that
spot
with
her
i
still
love
michel
s
interpret
too
much
to
drop
her
to
second
christoph
nolan
recent
said
that
he
d
definit
love
to
see
ann
in
her
own
spin
off
catwoman
movi
after
see
tdkr
i
total
see
whi
complet
agre
definit
load
of
selina
moment
in
here
the
action
is
quick
well
pace
but
not
in
a
way
that
is
tough
to
follow
the
fact
that
the
movi
isn
t
in
the
irksom
3d
is
serious
a
bless
no
blurri
action
here
it
s
good
to
see
the
differ
fight
style
of
our
three
main
charact
oh
let
me
just
add
here
if
catwoman
wa
one
reason
that
got
me
to
applaud
on
quit
a
few
occas
the
spectacular
bat
aircraft
wa
the
other
it
is
just
simpli
awesom
so
if
you
haven
t
surmis
as
yet

is
definit
a
must
watch
i
give
it
a
solid
9
5
