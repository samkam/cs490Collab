have
to
walk
a
veri
difficult
tightrop
when
describ
film
that
they
love
peopl
who
valu
our
opinion
for
whatev

expect
a
level
of
passion
and

knowledg
to
convinc
them
how
and
when
to
spend
their
hard

money
and
we
work
hard
to
provid
such
knowledg
and
passion
on
a
regular
basi
but
often
a
critic
will
revert
to
childhood
nostalgia
or
some
other
form
of
sentiment
to
unconvincingli
gloss
over
flaw
which
to
anyon
els
are
in
plain

i
find
myself
in
thi
posit
with
regard
to
find
nemo
a
film
i
saw
twice
in
cinema
dure
it
long
theatric
run
and
which
i
have
alway
held
in
high
regard
have
not
seen
it
for
sever
year
and
caught
up
with
most
of
pixar
s
back
catalogu
outsid
of
it
i
had
trepid
about
revisit
it
in
case
my
love
for
it
turn
out
to
be
root
pure
in
nostalgia
fortun
my
fear
have
all
been
laid
to
rest
by
the
simpl
fact
that
find
nemo
is
a
truli
great
film
for
starter
the
film
is
a
fantast
technic
accomplish
anim
s
abil
to
put
anyth
on

is
often
bizarr
use
to
belittl
it
achiev
we
assum
that
just
becaus
almost
everyth
can
be
done
that
therefor
it
s
veri
easi
to
do
anyth
but
there
is
noth
easi
or
lazi
about
find
nemo
s
aesthet
they
are
the
product
of
year
of
hard
work
and
research
by
highli
talent
craftsman
whose
craft
and
affect
show
through
john
lasset

honcho
and
the

ha
alway
been
a
fan

on

onc
the

who
rare
come
out
of
the
anemon
ad
believ
to
albert
brook
portray
of

the
visual
of
find
nemo
are
beauti
on
everi
level
andrew
stanton
and
lee
unkrich
bring
us
a
world
of
rich
colour
and
mani
textur
shade
all
the
while
convinc
us
that
we
are
underwat
they
pay
particular
attent
to
the
way
that
light
reflect
and
refract
as
it
move
from
the
surfac

the
denser
water
adjust
the
colour
palett
ever
so
subtli
whenev
we
move
into
deeper
territori
certain
mechan
are
alter
to
enabl
charact
to
cri
or
bleed
in
way
we
would
recognis
but
overal
thi
is
both
believ
and
realist
in
addit
to
it
spectacular
visual
find
nemo
is
a
brilliant
exampl
of
how
to
handl
multipl
stori
line
on
screen
like
toy
stori
2
befor
it
there
is
not
a
singl
edit
which
is
out
of
place
and
not
a
singl
section
that
run
on
too
long
the
transit
between
one
group
of
charact
and
anoth
group
are
beauti
judg
it
s
never
left
so
long
that
it
feel
like
we
are
neglect
a
charact
or
so
short
that
it
feel
desper
thi
in
turn
lift
the
stori
of
find
nemo
from
someth
seemingli
simpl
to
feel
more
complex
and
layer
it
is
at
it
most
basic
level
a
road
movi
with
two
charact
on
a
long
journey
from
a
to
b
encount
mani
strang
creatur
and
event
along
the
way
some
of
which
are
help
some
potenti
harm
in
weaker
hand
the
film
would
either
feel
overli
long
and
dull
or
could
becom
veri
episod
with
the
set
piec
not
build
to
a
reson
climax
but
thi
is
pixar
and
they
know
a
thing
or
two
about
rais
the
stake
the
film
ha
mani
memor
moment
each
of
which
feel
like
an
escal
from
the
previou
one
the
first
time
we
meet
bruce
the
shark
it
s
a
big
deal
but
after
the
underwat
mine
blow
up
and
the
angler
fish
arriv
he
seem
a
walk
in
the
park
by
comparison
the
same
goe
for
the
jellyfish
the
whale
and
final
the
fish
boat
which
marlin
and
dori
run
into
with
the
mask
and
it
messag
tie
everyth
togeth
veri
nice
run
through
find
nemo
is
the
theme
of
let
go
specif
parent
let
go
of
their
children
and
allow
them
to
have
their
own
adventur
marlin
is
overprotect
of
hi
son
nemo
becaus
of
the
loss
of
hi

and
other

in

an
attitud
consolid

the
lucki

long
nemo
is
compel
to

and
quickli
discov
how
frighten
it
can
be
as
the

journey
to
find
hi
son
both
discov
that
there
are
time
when
let
go
and
trust
other
is
the
onli
way
to
go
there
is
a
comparison
in
thi
regard
with
graviti
which
ha
just
garner
11
bafta
nomin
and
a

10
for
the

at
either
ceremoni
find
nemo
itself
an
oscar
winner
doe
a
much
better
job
at
convey
thi
underli
theme
while
their
stori
may
seem
equal
straightforward
on
paper
the
storytel
here
is
better
the
charact
are
more
round
and
there
is
less
of
an
overwhelm
sens
of
effect
corner
the
market
for
innov
as
great
as
the
visual
here
are
they
do
not
distract
from
the
stori
as
those
in
graviti
often
did
equal
while
graviti
s
protagonist
were
overli
convent
the
charact
in
find
nemo
are
as
round
and
compel
as
we
have
come
to
expect
from
pixar
marlin
s
conserv
natur
is
root
in
good
intent
and
he
ha
qualiti
that
we
would
recognis
in

we
know
and
admir
while
dreamwork
might
play

pure
for

here
it
both
lighten
the

ha
a
patho
to
her
which
come
to
a
head
when
she
and
marlin
part

make
her

moment
all
the
more
endear
in
addit
to
it

theme
find
nemo
also
ha
a
subtext
about
overcom

both
nemo

refer

the
shine
in
