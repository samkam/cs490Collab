richard
adam
classic
novel
watership
down
isn
t
just
about
rabbit
tackl
the
big
idea
includ
the
import
of
storytel
to
societi
adam
weav
an
adult
tale
of
human
struggl
cloak
as
a
book
about
bunni
when
i
wa
at
colleg
a
fellow
student
told
me
that
i
had
to
read
watership
down
when
i
ask
what
the
book
wa
about
i
rememb
him
tell
me
rabbit
on
the
move
tri
to
find
a
new
home
rabbit
my
eye
start
to
glaze
over
he
start
to
summar
the
stori
but
all
i
recal
wa
that
the
main
rabbit
wa
name
hazel
and
that
there
were
some
other
rabbit
name
bigwig
dandelion
fiver
and
pipkin
the
glaze
process
wa
complet
the
rest
of
the
pitch
came
across
as
blah
blah
blah
blah
thi
year
as
i
had
decid
to
read
and
write
about
book
involv
travel
rabbit
on
the
move
came
immedi
to
mind
and
i
ad
it
to
my
to
read
list
for
kc
unbound
and
i
must
say
that
thi
book
ha
probabl
been
the
biggest
pleasant
surpris
i
ve
had
in
read
in
the
past
decad
the
book
turn
out
to
be
so
much
more
than
bunni
on
a
trip
or
even
bunni
on
an
exodu
of
surviv
if
i
had
to
categor
the
book
i
d
probabl
group
it
with
epic
of
travel
some
review
compar
it
to
homer
s
odyssey
but
i
think
virgil
s
aeneid
would
be
a
more
apt
comparison
becaus
of
the
emphasi
on
person
respons
to
the
group
richard
adam
say
that
the
stori
began
as
a
seri
of
stori
he
told
hi
littl
girl
as
they
travel
on
long
drive
in
the
english
countrysid
that
may
be
though
these
stori
at
least
as
present
in
the
complet
novel
are
not
for
kid
and
parent
who
may
be
think
of
check
out
the
anim
film
of
watership
down
for
your
kid
watch
it
first
yourself
the
film
should
have
gotten
a
pg
13
rate
what
would
have
been
a
gp
at
the
time
of
releas
instead
of
g
in
my
opinion
there
s
a
fair
amount
of
violent
action
and
the
mood
of
most
of
the
narr
is
rather
unsettl
with
rabbit
on
the
cover
watership
might
seem
to
be
a
children
s
book
but
it
theme
and
present
are
much
too
complex
for
that
thi
is
a
book
that
ha
a
lot
that
would
traumat
a
youngster
especi
if
s
he
were
expect
someth
more
along
the
line
of
max
and
rubi
older
audienc
can
handl
the
tough
subject
matter
loss
terror
and
death
and
appreci
what
is
mainli
a
tale
about
the
import
of
commun
the
import
of
stori
in
foster
commun
and
the
valu
of
a
brave
heart
in
a
danger
world
one
of
the
peculiar
of
the
book
is
that
certain
word
are
given
in
lapin
the
languag
adam
imagin
for
the
rabbit
thi
is
somewhat
similar
to
what
anthoni
burgess
did
in
a
clockwork
orang
where
the
narrat
alex
de
farg
use
the
teen
slang
of
hi
day
nadsat
to
tell
hi
stori
the
differ
is
that
where
alex
whole
narrat
is
done
in
thi
slavic
rich
slang
adam
use
onli
a
rel
few
lapin
word
sprinkl
through
the
text
my
favorit
of
these
is
hrududu
the
rabbit
word
for
ani
motor
convey
becaus
of
the
sound
i
can
imagin
adam
daughter
giggl
everi
time
he
ha
a
rabbit
refer
to
a
hrududu
adam
also
suggest
that
other
anim
mice
and
bird
are
singl
out
have
their
own
languag
distinct
from
lapin
though
the
anim
can
commun
with
one
anoth
use
some
kind
of
pigeon
or
creol
strang
enough
adam
give
the
mice
a
french
accent
but
give
kehaar
the
gull
who
get
the
closest
to
the
rabbit
a
scandinavian
accent
of
cours
anim
don
t
speak
with
one
anoth
in
a
way
that
human
do
there
is
no
evid
that
anim
have
a
real
sens
of
past
or
that
they
narrat
stori
wherea
human
knowledg
of
the
world
is
veri
much
affect
by
our
be
the
anim
who
tell
and
listen
to
stori
other
than
the
use
of
languag
adam
chose
not
to
chang
the
behavior
of
the
rabbit
in
other
word
hi
rabbit
do
not
act
like
the
anim
in
aesop
s
fabl
or
like
cartoon
anim
like
human
in
anim
form
consid
the
biped
bug
bunni
adam
base
hi
rabbit
behavior
on
that
of
real
rabbit
from
hi
own
observ
and
from
read
book
such
as
r
m
lockley
s
the
privat
life
of
the

adam
place
howev
a
great
focu
on
stori
someth
that
rabbit
don
t
so
far
as
we
know
have
but
stori
permeat

work
when
the

a
thousand
enemi
the
mythic
trickster
rabbit
not
onli
do
they
have
stori
about
the
mythic
el
ahrairah
but
by
the
end
of
the
novel
it
is
clear
that
in
their
own
world
the
adventur
of
hazel
fiver
bigwig
dandelion
and
the
like
are
alreadi
in
the
process
of
becom
