them
nolan
use
thi
as
a
devic
for

us
as
well
and
also
as
the
occas
for
some
of
the
movi
s
astonish
special

which
seem
senseless
in
the
trailer
but
now
fit
right
in
the
most
impress
to
me
take
place
or
seem
to
in

where
the

who
may
be

like
the
mental
equival

whichev
they
are
they
lead
to
a
great
mani
