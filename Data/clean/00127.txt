at
9
00
am
when
i
wa
in
fifth
grade
my
dad
gave
me
a
big
stack
of
classic
book
that
in
retrospect
i
wa
probabl
too
young
to
read
on
christma
morn
i
rip
open
watership
down
billi
budd
mobi
dick
and
the
catcher
in
the
rye
a
book
i
end
up
read
voraci
albeit
with
a
bit
of
confus
i
couldn
t
possibl
have
understood
the
complex
of
holden
caulfield
and
sure
some
of
holden
s
adventur
like
call
a
prostitut
went
over
my
head
it
wa
certainli
the
first
book
i
read
with
the
f
word
i
specif
rememb
the
part
where
holden
is
shock
after
hi
prostitut
say
like
fun
and
i
rememb
wonder
what
wa
wrong
with
that
what
a
cool
say
like
fun
i
will
never
forget
open
those
book
it
wa
the
catalyst
of
my
love
relationship
with
read
i
m
glad
i
wa
expos
to
the
catcher
in
the
rye
at
such
a
young
age
it
s
one
of
those
book
that
s
worthi
of
a
good
read
everi
few
year
at
differ
stage
in
your
life
the
last
time
i
read

at
age
27
i
wa
struck
by
how
young
and
immatur
holden
seem
when
i
read
the
same
book
as
an
elementari
school
student
he
seem
old
and
wise
i
m
not
sure
all

would
invit
their
10
year
old
to
read
saling
s
classic
work
i
can
rememb
the
surpris
on
my
teacher
face
when
they
heard
what
i
got
for
christma
and
now
as
i
m
older
i
start
wonder
at
what
age
i
would
buy
my
kid
the
book
mayb
we
d
read
it
togeth
as
a
bedtim
stori
mayb
i
d
wait
until

for
some
10
