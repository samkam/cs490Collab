their

i
think
part
of
the
reason
richard

wrote
thi
book
wa
becaus
he
want
to
show
how
rabbit
live
and
how
their
live
are
affect
by
human
i
like
the
origin
of
thi
book
and
the
way
it
intertwin
a
view
of
the
world
through
a
rabbit
eye
within
a
human
world
i
also
like
how
the
stori
tell
of
their
journey
and
when
they
finish
the
journey
half
way
through
the
book
it
continu
with
a
new
problem
i
did
not
like
the
way
he
use
weird
made
up
word
to
describ
human
thing
becaus
it
made
the
stori
hard
to
read
and
awkward
despit
thi
thi
book
ha
earn
itself
a
five
star
rate
abov

thi
is
a
book
everyon
should
read
becaus
it
is
such
a
great
classic
and
show
a
new
view
on

i
would
also
like
to

the
dragon

a
great
work
of
literatur
i
had
to
read
watership
down
for
my
7th
grade
english
class
and
start
out
dislik
it
immens
i
mean
i
don
t
know
a
singl
seventh
grader
who
would
actual
enjoy
read
a
400
page
book
about
talk
rabbit
as
i
read
more
and
more
in
the
book
though
my
opinion
of
watership
down
chang
drastic
i
realiz
that
the
theme
and
charact
in
the
book
are
power
and
more
than
they
appear
to
be
the
charact
are
vivid
and
strong
and
i
especi
like
hazel
the
belov
and
courag
chief
rabbit
who
prove
hi
worth
again
and
again
to
hi
peopl
the
end
in
watership
down
wa
perfect
and
it
will
have
a
last
impress
on
me
my
advic
to
possibl
reader
is
thi
watership
down
is
a
great
book
ye
it
wa
sometim
slow
and
tiresom
but
it
wa
also
more
than
a
book
about
talk
rabbit
don
t
let
those
rabbit
stop
you
from
such
a
wonder
stori
i
wa
pleasantli
surpris
