mani
of
the
thing
that
i
love
about
thi
film
are
the
exact
thing
that
caus
my
discont
to
begin
with
much
of
the
visual
were
obvious
astound
the
design
of
the
planet
as
well
as
the
design
of
the
plant
and
anim
life
and
the
vehicl
use
by
the
human
were
incred
impress
cameron
also
use
color
veri
well
on
the
other
hand
the
comput
gener
charact
were
far
too
cartoonish
and
the
real
life
charact
and
comput
gener
one
didnt
blend
togeth
quit
as
well
as
i
had
hope
for
consid
how
advanc
thi
film
wa
suppos
to
be
i
would
have
much
rather
prefer
costum
and
make
up
than
the
cartoonish
look
the
film
had
while
the
planet
look
impress
david
lean
made
more
visual

film
use
actual
landscap
rather
than
artifici
one
the
stori
also
had
it
up
and
down
point
on
the
one
hand
the
stori
wa
engag
enough
that
even
after
160
minut
i
could
have
kept
watch
if
the
film
were
longer
on
the
other
hand
the
dialogu
wa
veri
weak
most
element
of
the
stori
were
complet
recycl
and
unorigin
and
the
main
antagonist
of
the
film
wa
as
cheesi
of
a
villain
as
we
could
have
receiv
he
wa
basic
a
caricatur
of
the
villain
of
the
corn
ball
action
flick
of
the
80
s
the
film
also
reli
too
much
on
the
demon
of
human
in
order
to
serv
it
agenda
cameron
left
the
entir
human
race

allow
no

the
mass

were
