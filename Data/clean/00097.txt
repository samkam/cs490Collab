lest
some

and
it
s
thi
buddi
christ
tradit
from
which
aslan
seem
to
spring
devoid
of
insight
wisdom
or
charm
aslan
is
just
here
to
do
thing
that
our
protagonist
can
t
do
thi
also
beggar
the
question
whi
didn
t
aslan
just
take
care
of
all
thi
stuff
long
befor
the
kid
arriv
whi
did
all
the
anim
and
fairi
and
giant
have
to
suffer
the
pain
of
an
endless
winter
except
for
a
vagu
mention
of
propheci
there
isn
t
ani
reason
for
aslan
to
wait
for
the
kid
sinc
in
the
end
he
doe
it
all
on
hi
own
anyway
the
onli
thing
the
kid
do
is
help
run
of
the
battl
but
thi
is
onli
necessari
becaus
aslan
is
absent
and
he
s
onli
absent
becaus
the
kid
screw
up
indic
that
the
entir
thing
would
have
gone
much
more
smoothli
if
they
had
never
been
there
in
the
first
place
in
that
regard
i
have
to
say
lewi
did
an
excel
job
boil
down
christian
into
a
fabl
and
leav
the
problem
of
evil
complet
intact
some
reader
suggest
that
aslan
let
the
queen
take
over
to
teach
the
kid
a
lesson
but
is
it
realli
worthwhil
to
let
all
the
inhabit
of
a
kingdom
suffer
a
centuri
of
miseri
just
to
teach
a
few
kid
about
the
true
mean
of
friendship
the
villain
is
just
as
poorli
construct
and
seem
less
concern
with
defeat
her
enemi
than
with
be
pointlessli
caprici
she
manag
to
trick
one
of
the
children
but
instead
of
take
advantag

thi
fact
she
immedi
make

she
trick

otherwis
they
never

it
is
interest
to
look
at
how
mani
christian
author
have
tri
to
reconcil
their
faith
with
complex
fairi
mytholog
not
that
christian
doesn

the

were

they
often
kept

and
magic
monster
were
also
given
a

in
the

in
the
middl
age
monk
compil
bestiari
which
describ
the
role
of
dragon
unicorn
and
real
anim
in
christian
synbol
there
were
even
centuri
span
debat
about
whether
dog
head
men
were
descend
from
adam
these
book
were
rare
accur
but
allow
christian
theolog
to
adopt
mani
stori
and
superstit
from
earlier
period
for
instanc
the
connect
between
unicorn
and
virgin
or
the
belief
that
pelican
fed
their
own
blood
to
their
young
in
imit
of
communion
so
lewi
attempt
to
take
myth
and
adapt
it
to
a
christian
cosmolog
is
hardli
new
there
is
a
long
and
stori
tradit
explor
throughout
the
chivalr
period
and
recogniz
today
in

lewi

a

these

protest
lewi
religion
wa
a
modern
one
not
magic

utilitarian

did
not
draw
on
the
elabor

apocrypha
of
hallucinatori
monster
and
miracl
that
mystic
obsess

he
made

rather

firstli
for

to

repres
christ
he
would
have

true

stori
in

word
he
would
have
to
be
god
made
into
man
come
to
die
for
all
mankind
howev
as
he
onli
die
for
the
one
traitor
again
it
s
not
stick
true
to
the
biblic
gospel
that
all
have
sin
and
that
christ
wa
need
as
a
sacrific
for
that
sin
if
you
take
thing
too
liter
here
c
s
lewi
novel
doesn
t
make
much
that
much
sens
theolog
as
a
result
i
ll
explain
where
i
am
wa
go
with
that
in
a
moment
2
i
debat
that
c
s
lewi
preach
in
hi
novel
occasion
he
can
be
a
touch
patronis
but
compar
to
mani
author
he
rare
slip
into
such
condescens
as
for
hi
moral
i
think
you
must
understand
it
from
the
perspect
of
christian
christian
is
about
black
and
white
moral
essenti
good
versu
evil
light
vs
dark
and
truth
vs
lie
etc
it
is
also
veri
grey
in
that
christian
is
about
life
and
the
fact
that
no
one
is
perfect
that
everyon
fit
into
that
moral
grey
area
of
cours
i
explain
roughli
and
inadequ
ultim
i
see
that
there
is
room
to
argu
that
c
s
lewi
doe
a
poor
job
of
write
an
allegor
novel
howev
i
see
it
as
a
veri
subtl
novel
that
unlik
other
for
instanc
the
alchemist
doe
not
build
it
stori
around
express
an
ideolog
but
rather
incorpor
an
ideolog
into
it
storytel
i
think
that
if
one
want
to
criticis
thi
novel
it
should
be
for
not
properli
show
the
gospel
rather
than
for
preach
i
know
that
i
and
mani
other
enjoy
the
stori
first
befor
see
the
connect
between
it
and
the
biblic
tale
i
enjoy
it
even
more
afterward
so
then
again
i
could
be
a
tad
bias
origin
reviewto
begin
i
must
note
that
i
grant
thi
such
a
high
rate
due
to
the
impact
it
had
on
my
life
it
to
me
is
one
novel
that
were
i
to
pick
the
one
novel
that
forg
a
love
of
book
for
me
it
would
be
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
whi
becaus
i
can
rememb
back
about
twelv
year
ago
when
i
wa
homeschool
by
my
mother
as
a
five
year
old
we
wander
down
dure
winter
into
the
warm
back
room
and
she
read
the
first
narnia
book
to
us
the
imag
of
a
red
faun
carri
parcel
as
he
pass
a
grow
lamppost
would
stick
with
me
from
that
moment
as
it
stuck
with
c
s
lewi
as
i
learn
to
read
the
narnia
book
were
the
first
novel
i
sunk
my
grow
read
teeth
into
and
to
thi
day
i
have
read
and
re
read
the
novel
back
to
front
and
mayb
front
to
back
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
is
a
novel
written
for
both
children
and
adult
it
contain
highli
allegor
element
as
c
s
lewi
wa
a
well
known
apologet
writer
howev
he
wrote
that
he
did
not
write
hi
novel
as
a
pure
allegori
but
as
a
stori
and
that
is
what
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
is
a
stori
to
be
enjoy
by
everyon
and
although
written
in
simpl
languag
the
reader
can
quickli
concis
and
easili
imagin
the
world
without
the
clumsi
constraint
of
overus
word
i
person
cannot
imagin
a
world
without
these
novel
addit
thought
1
just
a
question
at
last
and
one
with
a
highli
philosoph
twist
to
it
whi
is
it
that
peopl
so
readili
condemn
those
book
which
are
consid
as
moral
tale
you
d
think
we
could
do
with
more
moral
in
such
a
twist
and
confus
world
regardless
of
accept
the
belief
system
2
i
have
heard
mani
peopl
describ
the
entir
seri
as
silli
and
far
too
preachi
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
at
all
trust
me
if
c
s
lewi
want
to
be
preachi
he
would
have
written
a
lot
more
philosophi
and
less
stori
ye
i
can
see
how
some
would
call
thi
silli
but
then
i
argu
that
they
are
miss
the
point
it
s
a
fairytal
type
fantasi
intend
mainli
for
children
and
for
those
children
again
as
adult
or
for
their
parent
perhap
but
i
argu
that
as
lewi
onli
wrote
thi
stori
base
on
the
stori
of
the
crucifixion
in
mani
way
that
it
wa
not
intend
as
a
preachi
book
my
question
is
that
whi
is
it
that
if
i
were
to
base
a
stori
along
what
some
call
the
christian
myth
it
is
claim
as
preach
while
as
if
i
were
to
base
it
on
ani
other
mytholog
or
stori
it
would
be
deem
as
mere
copi
the
theme
of

is

up
about
it
either
he
mention
it
a
few
time
like
oh
i
would
show
you
thi
or
i
would
tell
you
thi
but
if
i
did
believ
me
you
wouldn
t
be
allow
to
read
thi
book
so
i
understand
that
he
might
ve
felt
the
need
to
portray
aslan
as
veri
strong
and
mighti
even
when
he
wa
shown
as
weak
and
to
give
the
impress
that
everyth
is
go
to
be
okay
for
the
children
you
know
but
for
me
and
i
m
not
a
kid
it
s
not
so
fun
and
get
bore
becaus
all
the
suspens
is
gone
mayb
that
s
whi
i
realli
like
the
witch
she
brought
with
her
a
kind
of
evil
and
power
and
she
s
a
woman
and
she
s
rule
i
don
t
care
if
she
s
not
suppos
to
she
s
pretti
awesom
and
she
s
fear
in
the
movi
she
seem
realli
realli
proud
to
me
and
i
like
that
i
kind
of
imagin
her
like
that
in
the
book
too
but
then
lewi
give
us
thi
haa
a
arrh
roar
aslan
half
rise
from
hi
throne
and
hi
great
mouth
open
wider
and
wider
and
the
roar
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
witch
after
stare
for
a
moment
with
her
lip
wide
apart
pick
up
her
skirt
and
fairli
ran
for
her
life
no
pleas
she
may
not
have
her
wand
but
i
don
t
think
she
would
pick
up
her
skirt
and
run
for
her
life
that
s
just
not
like
her
yeah
yeah
it
s
lewi
s
charact
and
what
do
i
know
but
serious
peopl
author
alway
screw
up
their
charact
without
notic
i
believ
thi
is
just
to
show
us
that
the
mighti
aslan
is
fear
by
all
and
if
that
the
witch
is
scare
of
him
yay
everyth
will
be
okay
i
also
don
t
like
the
idea
that
she
s
shown
as
all
bad
like
she
s
entir
evil
just
becaus
she
s
half
jinn
and
half
giant
ye
ye
it
s
a
children
s
book
and
the
evil
guy
is
just
evil
and
need
to
die
but
let
s
ignor
that
for
a
few
moment
i
d
heard
all
about
how
thi
book
is
full
of
christian
theme
and
idea
but
jinn
are
not
christian
are
they
i
don
t
think
they
are
let
me
tell
you
about
jinn
in
islam
there
are
human
angel
and
jinn
the
human
were
made
of
earth
clay
mud
whatev
you
prefer
call
it
the
angel
were
made
of
light
and
the
jinn
were
made
of
fire
out
of
the
three
creatur
onli
the
angel
are
pure
and
are
creat
to
obey
onli
they
do
not
or
cannot
commit
ani
sin
so
there
are
no
such
thing
as
fallen
angel
angel
remain
angel
and
they
are
power
creatur
that
serv
god
both
human
and
jinn
howev
have
free
will
they
can
choos
either
good
are
bad
and
they
have
both
good
and
evil
insid
them
satan
the
devil
is
a
jinn
he
wa
thrown
down
to
earth
becaus
he
defi
god
and
hi
promis
to
him
wa
that
by
the
time
the
day
of
judgement
arriv
he
ll
lead
as
mani
peopl
in
to
hell
as
he
can
in
a
thousand
and
one
night
or
arabian
night
whichev
version
you
know
of
jinn
are
portray
as
both
good
and
evil
the
good
one
are
call
faeri
fairi
i
think
in
the
english
translat
i
don
t
know
what
the
real
arab
version
call
them
but
if
i
ever
get
my
hand
on
it
i
ll
let
you
know
anyway
the
bad
jinn
are
call
just
jinn
i
think
and
they
are
the
follow
of
ibli
which
is
just
the
name
of
the
devil
what
i
m
tri
to
say
is
that
just
like
human
the
jinn
have
both
good
and
bad
they
can
be
evil
and
they
can
be
good
so
when
the
beaver
tell
the
children
that
the
white
witch
is
all
bad
and
ha
no
good
in
her
becaus
she
s
half
jinn
and
half
giant
be
the
daughter
of
lilith
my
reaction
wa
excus
me
there
is
no
lilith
in
islam
and
i
m
not
veri
sure
about
giant
though
i
do
think
they
appear
in
a
thousand
and
one
night
but
they
might
be
some
way
associ
to
jinn
but
if
she
s
part
jinn
then
she
ha
some
good
in
her
dammit
lewi
burrow
all
sort
of
thing
with
hi
giant
and
tree
spirit
and
all
of
that
but
come
on
whi
would
you
just
take
thi
jinn
and
insert
it
into
your
stori
just
becaus
i
know
as
a
writer
he
s
free
to
take
whatev
he
want
but
that
just
doesn
t
make
sens
at
all
if
we
re
look
at
it
from
how
islam
view
jinn
then
there
s
her
name
the
white
witch
whi
is
she
the
white
witch
if
she
is
realli
all
bad
whi
pick
the
color
white
isn
t
that
pure
innoc
clean
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
good
thing
in
the
west
i
guess
you
can
say
it
s
becaus
the
winter
or
the
ice
but
hey
there
are
other
color
too
there
s
blue
there
s
gray
or
he
could
just
not
go
with
color
at
all
he
could
call
her
the
ice
witch
the
winter
witch
the
snow
witch
i
don
t
know
we
talk
about
thi
in
class
too
like
whi
white
so
i
said
well
she
s
half
jinn
that
wa
when
i
didn
t
know
that
there
were
no
such
thing
as
jinn
in
christian
and
they
were
like
is
jinn
white
i
don
t
realli
know
but
if
i
were
to
pick
a
color
for
jinn
it
would
be
white
i
even
went
home
and
ask
my
mother
and
she
answer
white
automat
without
even
think
about
it
mayb
it
s
becaus
in
islam
jinn
are
be
that
live
among
our
world
but
mind
their
busi
if
you
mind
your
busi
mayb
think
of
them
as
spirit
or
ghost
hate
to
call
them
ghost
but
just
for
now
they
re
invis
to
you
though
so
white
just
make
sens
mayb
it
s
some
influenc
of
eastern
cultur
on
me
that
i
m
not
awar
of
but
ye
a
ladi
jinn
white
fit
her
so
i
just
cannot
see
her
as
someon
who
is
entir
bad
or
evil
she
s
half
jinn
she
s
given
the
color
white
and
to
me
thi
woman
had
some
reason
for
do
what
she
s
do
i
know
in
the
stori
it
s
definit
no
what
the
fuck
are
you
talk
about
did
you
even
read
but
could
lewi
have
done
a
better
job
with
her
uh
yeah
come
on
jinn
are
fascin
you
know
what
i
think
i
ll
write
someth
about
jinn
someday
someday
i
swear
i
had
more
to
say
about
her
but
move
on
aslan
hi
charact
is
okay
till
around
the
part
he
get
sacrif
oh
wait
no
that
s
not
it
it
s
when
he
get
reborn
no
that
s
not
it
either
oh
yeah
it
s
when
he
start
chase
the
girl
and
goe
yaaaay
i
m
a
kitti
come
play
with
me
tickl
me
can
i
hug
you
yaaaaaayyy
oh
shit
girl
we
ve
got
a
war
go
on
and
we
have
some
save
to
do
stop
fool
around
and
get
on
my
back
we
gonna
go
rescu
ah
hah
ha
no
serious
doe
anyon
understand
what
happen
there
i
think
lewi
wa
tri
to
make
aslan
not
seem
like
the
christ
figur
so
he
insert
that
silli
and
complet
out
of
charact
scene
in
there
i
mean
he
get
sacrif
for
protect
a
boy
for
the
greater
good
don
t
you
see
him
as
a
christ
figur
it
s
like
lewi
went
oh
crap
thi
dude
s
a
lion
everyon
s
go
to
talk
about
thi
now
and
peopl
would
hate
me
for
it
or
i
should
ask
is
it
okay
to
compar
anim
to
human
i
don
t
realli
know
much
about
christian
so
i
guess
i
can
t
talk
much
about
that
but
aslan
buddi
when
you
roar
everyon
ran
the
fuck
away
whi
are
you
suddenli
act
like
a
littl
babi
it
might
ve
work
a
littl
better
if
we
saw
aslan
act
more
childlik
with
the
arriv
of
the
kid
so
suddenli
come
back
to
life
and
play
around
a
bit
would
have
been
there
in
hi
charact
wait
wait
actual
no
no
even
if
you
say
like
oh
it
s
like
a
whole
rebirth
thing
and
he
s
all
young
and
full
of
energi
now
do
you
not
realiz
that
there
s
a
war
go
on
they
just
fool
around
for
like
hour
and
suddenli
it
s
all
busi
that
make
no
sens
if
lewi
had
shown
him
as
a
more
happi
fun
love
charact
with
the
kid
befor
it
still
would
ve
been
realli
realli
stupid
of
him
to
wast
hour
just
chase
around
the
girl
and
if
you
say
well
when
he
play
around
he
wa
right
on
time
for
everyth
els
that
happen
still
no
it
s
a
book
you
can
write
it
a
billion
way
and
make
it
work
but
thi
doe
not
work
no
wonder
they
cut
that
out
in
the
movi
it
s
complet
stupid
okay
final
to
susan
i
think
i
mention
someth
about
the
essay
i
had
to
write
when
i
wa
read
thi
book
so
that
essay
turn
into
a
comparison
between
thi
and
alic
s
adventur
in
wonderland
it
wa
about
cultur
war
societi
and
someth
i
don
t
know
but
i
talk
a
bit
about
whi
thi
or
that
wa
not
includ
so
i
ll
skip
most
of
that
here
there
s
one
import
question
left
though
whi
wa
susan
given
a
freak
bow
and
arrow
whi
wa
luci
given
a
knife
whi
wa
susan
who
wa
older
than
edmund
not
particip
in
the
war
with
her
freak
amaz
bow
which
never
miss
whi
would
you
give
someon
someth
that
they
never
end
up
use
whi
would
you
send
the
younger
child
to
war
whi
not
send
two
of
the
older
one
and
leav
two
of
the
younger
one
to
get
a
littl
closer
edmund
treat
luci
like
shit
don
t
you
think
if
edmund
and
luci
spent
time
togeth
dure
that
aslan
is
get
sacrif
bit
they
d
get
to
know
each
other
better
more
bond
time
or
is
it
becaus
one
s
a
guy
and
the
other
a
girl
they
wouldn
t
like
to
be
in
each
other
s
compani
ohthat
snotonequestionsorrywhat
is
the
reason
for
edmund
be
such
an
ass
i
think
the
movi
did
a
better
job
with
thi
if
i
rememb
right
he
wa
all
grouchi
and
mean
becaus
he
miss
hi
daddi
or
both
hi
parent
i
m
not
sure
but
becaus
of
the
war
that
make
a
ton
of
sens
so
whi
doe
susan
have
such
an
amaz
weapon
if
she
doe
not
use
it
she
use
it
in
the
movi
so
that
wa
good
but
realli
you
have
someth
that
will
strike
anyth
you
aim
for
and
you
don
t
use
it
it
just
make
no
sens
whi
is
that
amaz
weapon
in
thi
book
oh
but
thi
is
onli
one
book
what
do
i
know
about
the
rest
of
the
seri
i
ask
and
they
told
me
she
doesn
t
do
ani
archeri
and
she
doesn
t
kick
ani
ass
and
you
know
that
s
okay
it
would
be
fine
if
susan
and
luci
were
both
shown
as
the
charact
who
were
more
caretak
support
helper
instead
of
fighter
but
whi
giver
her
the
freak
bow
what
s
that
there
for
luci
is
given
a
dagger
and
told
to
use
it
onli
when
she
realli
need
to
a
littl
kid
given
a
dagger
in
a
time
of
war
told
it
s
danger
and
onli
to
use
when
she
ha
to
all
right
i
understand
she
doesn
t
use
it
and
i
understand
she
didn
t
need
to
instead
that
potion
heal
thing
wa
more
import
but
susan
she
s
given
a
horn
to
blow
when
she
need
help
and
she
s
given
an
amaz
freak
weapon
she
use
the
horn
but
not
that
amaz
weapon
i
feel
sorri
for
that
weapon
i
realli
do
it
s
like
if
i
buy
chocol
and
i
never
eat
it
what
a
wast
think
about
it
a
littl
though
if
susan
had
practic
a
bit
she
might
ve
even
save
aslan
from
get
sacrif
mayb
she
could
ve
hid
in
the
shadow
and
fire
an
arrow
at
the
white
witch
or
someth
oh
but
there
wa
no
need
you
say
aslan
wa
fine
so
are
you
just
go
to
ignor
the
fact
that
one
of
the
charact
ha
an
amaz
weapon
just
so
it
doesn
t
mess
with
your
plot
and
think
about
how
awesom
she
would
ve
been
if
she
did
take

some
brush

i

it
as
a

an
even

envis
of

which
were
otherwis
bombast
in

of

not

still
preserv

thi

i

surpris
at
the

of
peopl

dislik
thi

i
guess
the
christian
allegori
wa
the
most
potent
instig
but
one
must
rememb
that
the
book
is
not
simpli
rever
for
be
an
infam
christian
allegori
i
wa
around
8
or
9
when
i
read
thi
novel
and
the
christian
allegori
flew
over
my
head
when
i
found
out
the
stori
wa
built
on
christian
allegori
i
ll
admit
becaus
it
s
built
from
a
religion
i
don
t
follow
i
wa
a
bit
fluster
but
i
realiz
the
christian
allegori
didn
t
realli
ruin
the
stori
neil
gaiman
s
view
are
quit
similar
to
my
own
as

my
upset

i
think
that
it
made
less
of
narnia
for
me
it
made
it
less
interest
a
thing
less
interest
a
place
still
the
lesson
of
narnia
sank
deep
aslan
tell
the
tash
worshipp
that
the
prayer
he
had
given
to
tash
were
actual
prayer
to
him
wa
someth
i
believ
then
and
ultim
still
believ
i
think
perhap
the
geniu
of
lewi
wa
that
he
made
a
world
that
wa
more
real
to
me
than
the
one
i

there

just
a

that
add
to
