realli
how
the
premis
i
am
sure
you
know
is

ten
peopl
end
up
cut
off
from
the

on
a
tini

one
of

it
s
the
kind
of

where

must

requir
the
structur

to
be

clean
cut
i
felt
that
it
wa
onli
right
for
me
to
approach
the
read
of
it
in
an
equal
disciplin
way
i
took
five
sheet
of
paper
and
divid
each
in
half
thu
end
up
with
ten
card
one
for
each
charact
and
i
continu
to
dillig
fill
them
out
with
all
the
detail
i
learnt
about
the
charact
until
about
halfway
through
the
book
when
i
becam
too
engross
frighten
and
nervou
i
alreadi
had
an
inkl
as
to
who
the
murder
wa
and
wa
petrifi
i
would
be
murder
in
my
sleep
as
well
the
situat
wa
veri
seriou
and
i
had
to
invit
all
my
teddi
bear
back
to
my
bed
so
they
could
protect
me
i
grew
to
like
two
of
the
charact
the
sentiment
i
think
i
share
with

a
remark
read
great
atmospher
where
you
feel
as
trap
as
those
peopl
on
that
island
i
want
to
comment
that
at
some
point
i
figur
it
out
who
wa
the
murder
don
t
worri
i
won
t
tell
it
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
would
say
oh
sure
i
believ
you
sherlock
howev
i
do
inde
discov
it
thi
is
not
my
first
mysteri
stori
i
have
read
sever
book
in
the
genr
and
i
have
watch
a
lot
of
tv
show
like
murder
she
wrote
columbo
crimin
mind
csi
miami
etc
and
while
that
doesn
t
turn
me
into
a
detect
in
my
defens
i
knew
who
wa
onli
becaus
i
focus
on
the
whi
and
not
the
how
that
certainli
i
didn

know
that
you
can
say
that
i
did
an
amateur

and
that
help
me
to
have
a
suspect
of
my
own
that
it
result
true
also
i
had
some
advantag
for
be
spanish
speak
sinc
there
is
a
clue
that
onli
can
be
detect
due
that
not
matter
that
i
read
the
novel
on
english
but
take
in
account
the
veri
detail
that
it
s
inde
a

catch
someth
and
put
togeth
some
clue
well
i
figur
it
out
believ
or
not
it
doesn

matter
anyway
i
think
that
mani
of
the
fun
of
read
thi
kind
of
mysteri
novel
is
tri
to
figur
out
the
culprit
dure
the
process
of
read
the
book
not

if
you
guess
right
or
not
alway

reward
when
the
mysteri
is
explain
a
delici
way
to
make
your
neuron
to
exercis
again
know
who
wa
or
at
least
think
that
i
knew
who
wa
sinc
obvious
i
couldn
t
confirm
it
until
read
the
whole
book
it
didn
t
help
me
to
know
how
everyth
wa
made
until
it
wa
explain
on
the
novel
definit
agatha
christi
is
the
queen
of

thi

isn
t
onli
a

i
found
thank
that
i
am
a
born
spanish
languag
speaker
warn
warn
warn
warn
read
onli
if
you
alreadi
read
the
novel
sinc
thi
is
a
mega
spoiler
tell
who
the
culprit
is
i
seldom
put
spoiler
in
my
review
but
i
wrote
thi
appendix
basic
sinc
i
wa
contact
by
sever
reader
ask
me
about
the
big
clue
and
well
while
i
don
t
mind
to
share
it
well
also
i
don
t
want
to
find
out
later
that
it
wa
written
down
in
some
other
review
as
their
take
in
account
that
it
seem
that
onli
me
were
the
one
who
notic
that
view
spoiler
ok
the
big
fuzz
about
the
clue
that
i
found
is
that
the
first
charact
that
you
find
in
the
novel
is
mr
justic
wargrav
on
the
chapter
one
you
may
say
so
what
well
the
mysteri
coupl
who
invit
to
all
guest
the
initi
of
both
name
of
them
are
u
n
o
in
the
imaginari
woman
is
una
nanci
owen
and
the
suppos
husband
is
u
n
owen
u
n
o
that
in
spanish
can
be
spell
just
like
uno
which
mean
one
on
english
mayb
that
a
coincid
but
with
agatha
christi
noth
can
be
left
to
chanc
so
i
think
that
may
be
a
clue
target
to
the

s
chang
a

in
her
most

then
she
said
someth
like
she
is

on

break

i
m
sure
you
can
think
of
mani
film
show
and
book
that
have
paid
homag
to
thi
theme
thi
classic
crime
novel
look
at
the
idea

ha

what
happen
when
the

fail
i
m
go
to
tri
to
avoid

tell

who

most
peopl
would
have
read

and
probabl
rememb
who
the
perpetr
wa
the

believ

are

in
most
fact
while
they
deni
be
guilti
public
are
live
torment
live
not
everyon
but
it
wa
interest
to
see
that
kind
of
turmoil
and
i
wa
a
littl
upset
to
see
that
wasn
t
explor
in
greater
detail
have
said
that
i
think
the
torment
play
out
more
in
the
symbol
and
motif
i
m
think
about
the
dream
and
hallucin
the
guilti
conscienc
of
the
victim
are
explor
here
or
the
storm
a
symbol
of
violenc
that
cut
them
off
from
the
world
the
killer
ha
set
out
to
commit
the
perfect
crime
and
it
look
good
on
paper
but
i
never
realli
bought
into
it
while
read
thi
novel
i
had
a
feel
that
the
cosi
crime
approach
is
play
against
the
stori
if
you
think
about
the
mess
made
from
the
violent
murder
wouldn
t
help
the
polic
work
out
what
happen
in
the
end
i
m
sure
they
wouldn
t
reli
on
the
handwritten
account
the
evid
would
be
inconsist
make
thi
far
from
a
perfect
crime
sorri
thi
is
hard
to
explain
without
spoiler
thi
wa
my
first
agatha
christi
novel
and
while
i
enjoy
it
there
is
one
thing
that
frustrat
me
i
hate
crime
novel
that
hold
back
import
piec
of
evid
and
expect
the
reader
to
work
out
what
happen
i
alway
feel
like
the
author
is
tri
to
be
smug
but
realli
it
is
just
poorli
execut
write
it
wasn
t
so
bad
in
thi
novel
but
i
get
the
feel
it
is
a
common
occurr
in
all
her
novel
and
i
can
t
stand
that
you
have
to
make
a
great
protagonist
to
make
up
for
the
withhold
of
inform
it
work
better
as
a
first

narr
the
unreli
narrat
is
more
like
to
forget
to
tell
you
import
clue
i
will
read
some
more
christi
i
hope
i
m
mistaken
about
the
withhold
of

then
there
were

had
no

mayb

quella
dei

per

è
il
noto
schema
di
delitto
in
villa
chiusa
che
gli
sciagurati
adoratori
di
cartoni
animati

me
troveranno
molto
ricorrent
anch
in

creati
dall

libro
sono
molto
diversi
di
quelli
che
ci
aspetteremmo
da
lei
hanno
più
spessor
del
solito
ad
esempio
sono
tormentati
ombrosi
ambigui
si
muovono
in
un
clima
di
paura
e
di
accusa
che
li
sping
a
mettersi

altro

ignorano

sia

nemico
un
giallo
angosciant

non

avviso
superior

al

amoral

io
sono
allergica

adoro
