in

post
i
m
go
to
talk
about
the
author
that
have
had
the
most
impact
on
me
and
my
write
and
what
i
took
away
from
them
first
up
j
r
r
tolkien
jrr
tolkien
is
the
reason
i
love
fantasi
from
the
time
my
uncl
gave
me
a
copi
of
the
hobbit
in
the
fourth
grade
to
when
i
read
the
silmarillion
and
the
unfinish
tale
look
for
more
middl
earth
to
consum
after
i
read
the
lord
of
the
ring
i
wa
hook
on
fantasi
it
wa
the
step
stone
that
gave
me
thi
wonder
fantast
world
that
is
fantasi
everywher
in
tolkien
s
world
there
is
some
new
magic
to
find
whether
your
traips
through
the
old
forest
hope
old
man
willow
doesn
t
take
a
dislik
to
you
or
cross
the
dead
marsh
and
tri
to
avoid
the
lure
of
the
candl
i
learn
the
joy
of
awe
and
wonder
but
it
wasn
t
just
my
love
of
fantasi
that
i
learn
from
tolkien
he
taught
me
one
of
the
greatest
truth
noth
is
free
everyth
truli
great
from
save
the
world
to
save
the
shire
is
paid
in
pain
your
charact
s
journey
shouldn
t
be
easi
thing
shouldn
t
just
fall
into
their
lap
they
have
to
reach
and
struggl
to
overcom
the
obstacl
place
befor
them
and
those
obstacl
should
have
a
last
effect
on
the
charact
everyon
is
chang
in
lord
of
the
ring
but
none
more
so
than
our
erstwhil
hero
frodo
tolkien
serv
in
the
trench
in
ww1
and
it
show
as
frodo
march
into
hi
own
liter
hell
and
walk
out
carri
not
onli
physic
wound
but
emot
wound
and
not
just
frodo
all
the
hobbit
were
mark
chang
suffer
their
own
ptsd
they
return
home
and
find
they
cannot
talk
about
their
experi
to
anyon
becaus
onli
when
you
ve
gone
through
suffer
can
you
understand
it
tolkien
learn
the
lesson
that
noth
is
free
and
he
taught
it
to
hi
charact
do
not
be
afraid
to
let
your
charact
suffer
do
not
be
afraid
to
let
your
charact
be
scar
by
their
obstacl
if
it
come
too
easi
then
where
is
the
tension
where
are
the
stake
how
can
your
reader
care
if
they
know
your

is
go

succeed
easili
and
that
s
the
last
lesson
