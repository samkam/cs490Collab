read
narnia
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
post
in
book
review
book
by
claresg
i
would
say
that
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
is
probabl
the
most
well
known
book
in
the
narnia
seri
and
although
it
is
onli
the
second
in
the
line
up
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
pivot
in
it
we
are
introduc
to
the
pevensi
children
peter
susan
luci
and
edmund
who
reappear
in
futur
book
and
we
see
more
of
narnia
post
creation
i
feel
like
the
plot
of
thi
book
is
fairli
well
known
luci
find
narnia
through
the
wardrob
she
walk
into
a
world
enchant
into
an
etern
winter
with
no
christma
at
the
hand
of
the
white
witch
with
the
help
of
the
magic
creatur
of
narnia
and
aslan
of
cours
the
children
set
out
to
bring
back
spring
but
of
cours
not
everyth
goe
to
plan
i
found
luci
and
edmund
to
be
the
most
interest
of
the
children
peter
and
susan
kind
of
take
on
the
role
of
parent
as
the
two
oldest
and
while
peter
doe
have
a
good
stori
arc
of
accept
hi
role
of
high
king
of
narnia
i
just
found
edmund
and
luci
to
be
the
most
interest
edmund
is
an
interest
charact
becaus
he
is
peg
as
the
evil
one
when
he
follow
luci
into
narnia
when
he
get
there
he
meet
the
white
witch
who
offer
him
whatev
he
want
in
the
way
of
food
and
he
snack
on
the
turkish
delight
that
she
give
him
i
ve
actual
had
turkish
delight
when
i
wa
in
turkey
freshman
year
of
colleg
and
it
is
pretti
good
i
will
alway
connect
it
with
thi
stori
i
have
often
thought
that
in
a
way
it
is
easier
to
write
bad
charact
than
good
charact
they
don
t
alway
have
to
play
by
the
rule
and
they
often
have
interest
motiv
and
back
stori
not
that
good
charact
don
t
but
there
s
just
someth
about
a
villain
s
back
stori
that
i
am
realli
interest
in
i
think
c
s
lewi
doe
a
good
job
with
thi
in
edmund
and
the
role
that
he
play
in
the
book
first
off
edmund
himself
isn
t
bad
in
the
way
that
mani
villain
are
he
just
come
across
the
villain
first
and
fall
in
with
her
befor
narnia
he
s
kind
of
the
lost
child
in
the
line
up
he
alway
pick
on
luci
and
give
her
a
hard
time
and
scold
by
hi
older
sibl
he
isn
t
as
close
with
the
rest
of
them
as
they
are
with
each
other
so
when
the
white
witch
give
him
special
attent
he
can
t
help
but
feel
love
the
interest
part
of
edmund
s
charact
is
when
he
return
to
the
white
witch
and
her
castl
on
hi
second
trip
to
narnia
with
hi
sibl
he
goe
back
to
the
witch
after
see
how
she
took
mr
tumnu
i
love
mr
tumnu
and
jame
mcavoy
and
hear
about
the
terror
she
inflict
on
narnia
from
mr
and
mr
beaver
love
them
too
but
he
still
goe
back
after
he
heard
about
aslan
from
the
beaver
becaus
the
witch
promis
him
that
he
could
be
king
over
narnia
and
that
he
would
have
power
over
hi
sibl
particularli
peter
on
thi
read
i
thought
edmund
wa
a
veri
well
flush
out
charact
he
wa
veri
realist
in
hi
desir
and
flaw
and
c
s
lewi
doe
a
good
job
of
make
him
relat
he
isn
t
at
the
white
witch
s
castl
for
veri
long
befor
he
realiz
that
thi
is
not
what
he
had
in
mind
she
turn
veri
cruel
to
him
and
there
are
no
more
promis
of
power
or
turkish
delight
so
while
a
larg
part
of
hi
charact
is
strive
for
power
and
recognit
abov
hi
sibl
the
rest
of
hi
charact
is
tri
to
get
back
to
them
after
see
the
cruelti
of
the
white
witch
luci
is
anoth
favorit
of
mine
mayb
it
s
becaus
she
and
mr
tumnu
are
such
good
pal
and
i
want
to
join
them
for
tea
or
mayb
it
becaus
she
is
the
youngest
and
the
first
one
to
find
narnia
the
other
write
it
all
off
as
her
be
an
imagin
littl
girl
but
are
proven
wrong
when
they
end
up
in
the
snowi
wood
themselv
she
is
also
the
one
that
ha
the
closest
relationship
to
aslan
throughout
the
book
which
i
think
is
a
realli
interest
detail
that
lewi
chose
to
hone
in
on
i
wa
talk
about
thi
with
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
also
read
the
narnia
book
recent
and
it
is
interest
to
look
at
the
reaction
of
variou
charact
throughout
the
seri
as
they
meet
aslan
i
will
be
talk
about
thi
more
in
futur
post
as
well
but
some
are
frighten
some
are
hesit
some
are
doubt
and
other
are
reliev
when
the
pevensi
first
hear
about
aslan
lewi
write
at
the
name
of
aslan
each
one
of
the
children
felt
someth
jump
in
it
insid
edmund
felt
a
sensat
of
mysteri
horror
peter
felt
suddenli
brave
and
adventur
susan
felt
as
if
some
delici
smell
or
some
delight
strain
of
music
had
just
float
by
her
and
luci
got
the
feel
you
have
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morn
and
realiz
that
it
is
the
begin
of
the
holiday
or
the
begin
of
summer
luci
is
alway
the
one
that
is
happiest
and
the
most
free
around
aslan
and
lewi
is
realli
show
the
whole
concept
of
child
like
faith
through
her
i
also
feel
like
she
is
the
pevensi
that
is
focus
on
the
most
throughout
the
seri
and
she
is
the
one
that
is
closest
to
aslan
and
now
on
to
aslan
himself
i
said
that
thi
is
a
pivot
book
in
the
seri
becaus
it
realli
set
up
aslan
charact
for
the
rest
of
the
seri
in
the
first
one
it
is
clear
that
he
is
special
becaus
he
is
the
one
that
sing
narnia
into
exist
but
in
lion
witch
wardrob
we
see
him
in
a
relationship
with
those
around
him
and
most
importantli
spoiler
alert
he
die
not
onli
doe
he
die
but
he
die
for
edmund
and
then
he
come
back
again
kind
of
like
jesu
i
first
read
lion
witch
wardrob
that
is
go
to
be
my
name
for
it
sinc
it
is
a
long
titl
to
type
out
in
third
grade
read
and
i
wa
so
sad
by
the
fact
that
aslan
die
that
i
had
forgotten
he
came
back
to
life
again
i
also
never
realli
put
it
togeth
with
the
jesu
metaphor
becaus
i
did
not
read
it
in
that
context
we
watch
the
aslan
s
death
scene
in
class
from
the
old
movi
and
i
rememb
it
be
realli
scari
it
definit
affect
me
and
that
wa
without
the
religi
connot
which
i
think
realli
is
a
nod
to
the
write
and
the
scene
itself
it
is
power
i
rewatch
the
new
version
of
the
movi
a
few
month
ago
and
i
wa
also
blown
away
by
it
then
as
well
i
knew
the
plot
by
then
of
cours
but
it
wa
the
first
time
i
had
revisit
the
stori
sinc
realli
becom
a
christian
in
high
school
and
i
just
had
a
lot
of
feel
about
that
scene
in
gener
first
of
all
edmund
left
to
go
to
the
witch
s
castl
after
hear
about
aslan
as
it
said
earlier
he
wa
fill
with
fear
he
heard
about
who
aslan
wa
and
he
turn
away
he
never
even
met
him
like
the
other
did
but
he
wa
the
one
that
aslan
die
for
so
that
he
could
have
a
second
chanc
and
be
reunit
with
the
rest
of
hi
sibl
also
he
left
so
that
he
could
gain
power
and
becom
king
but
there
wa
a
prophesi
that
said
he
and
the
rest
of
the
pevensi
were
go
to
be
king
and
queen
of
narnia
which
turn
out
to
be
much
better
than
what
the
witch
had
plan
for
him
he
is
the
one
that
goe
through
the
most
charact
develop
throughout
the
book
and
is
pivot
to
the
stori
itself
i
have
a
lot
of
feel
about
the
narnia
seri
and
thi
book
in
gener
and
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
i
am
go
to
stop
here
