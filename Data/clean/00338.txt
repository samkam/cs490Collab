i
recomend
guest
i
have
view
your
review
i
muat
say
i
don
t
agre
with
your
synopsi
of
the
video
i
agre
that
the
phantom
menac
ha
it
fault
and
flaw
but
it
obviou
that
you
grew
up
with
the
origin
three
movi
and
have
a
close
opinion
on
the
newer
one
as
most
star
war
fanboy
have
darkcyberelf
i
wa
born
in
the
90
s
and
wa
about
8
or
9
year
old
when
i
first
saw
thi
film
and
i
m
go
to
be
honest
i
didn
t
know
what
the
hell
wa
go
on
and
i
certainli
don
t
know
now
it
is
the
most
confus
and
pointless
of
the
star
war
film
is
it
entertain
ye
at
time
but
mostli
it
s
just
complet
shit
compar
to
the
simplic
origin
and
develop
the
origin
trilog
had
everyth
thi
guy
said
wa
complet
valid
regardless
of
which
film
you
prefer
i
person
like
thi
film
but
for
illog
reason
thi
movi
is
bad
thi
is
the
worst
star
war
movi
those
are
fact
he
ha
just
proven
okorugaijin
the
secur
chief
say
their
secur
volunt
which
make
them
sound
like
mall
cop
or
concert
bouncer
these
are
the
peopl
in
charg
of
protect
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
planet
would
be
no
match
against
a
battl
harden
feder
armi
what
when
the
big
final
battl
take
place
they
re
almost
entir
fight
regiment
of
droid
the
term
battl
harden
refer
to
someon
who
ha
been
through
numer
war
and
conflict
and
ha
had
their
sensit
resili
and
train
steel
over
as
a
result
usual
thi
person
is
pretti
valuabl
in
a
fight
battl
harden
would
be
appropri
if
you
were
refer
to
like
a
human
or
some
other
type
of
carbon
base
life
form
that
could
experi
thing
like
fear
pain
or
emot
but
these
are
fuck
robot
the
most
life
like
thing
they
do
is
say
roger
roger
back
to
the
giant
comput
that
probabl
control
them
they
re
not
the
fuck
uruk
hai
besid
from
the
way
the
jedi
cut
these
thing
in
half
by
the
dozen
i
d
say
they
re
pretti
expend
not
valuabl
they
re
like
cheap
plastic
toy
that
all
look
the
same
cue
we
re
in
the
money
music
as
soon
as
one
get
demolish
it
just
get
replac
by
anoth
on
that
look
exactli
the
same
and
ha
the
same
order
they
don
t
need
to
be
battl
harden
from
numer
conflict

with
your
point
that
he

almost
as

i
realli
like
the
three
old
movi
becaus
of
the
stori
and
the
great
idea
but
what
captur
my
attent
in
the
star
war
saga
wa
exactli
what
isn
t
consid
so
good
the
action
although
it
doe
not
fit
well
in
the
univers
of
star
war
the
paper
of
the
action
in
the
new
trilog
is
to
attract
the
new
audienc
make
it
justifi
and
what
sabotag
the
new
movi
is
the
number
of
detail
that
were
tri
to
be
put
in
the
movi
becaus
of
the
lack
of
answer
in
the
old
trilog
they
put
a
lot
of
detail
becaus
they
need
not
onli
to
tell
a
new
stori
but
to
explain
an
alreadi
exist
one
thi
make
difficult
to
conceal
and
the
problem
are
seen
more
easili
as
a
17
year
old
nerd
i
would
put
the
film
in
thi
order
worst
i
iii
iv
ii
v
vi
best
i
would
put
thi
in
my
opinion
that
nobodi
need
to
share
if
you
don
t
will
to
becaus
of
the
action
involv
and
the
stori
and
in
the
problem
in
the
stori
appear
not
onli
in
the
new
trilog
who
would
put
a
week
point
in
a
massiv
weapon
like
the
death
star
whi
there
is
a

that
take

whi

return
of
the

that
movi
is
the
worst
of
the
ot
by
far
and
i
d
argu
the
worst
of
the

the
onli
reason
an

would
enjoy
that

is
if
they
saw
it
as
a

and
are
incap

meanwhil
on

a

and
intellig

see
thi
and
sens
an
opportun
to
turn
one
of
the
most
power
jedi
ever
produc
into
hi
loyal
servant
all
he
ha
to
do
is
lie
and
tell
the
young
man
that
on
the
dark
side
there
realli
is
a
way
to
save
hi

and
so
anikin
allow

to
be
corrupt
and
by
the
time
he
realiz
what
is
happen
he
s
too
late
to
chang
what
he
s
becom
or
the
horribl
thing
he
ha
done
he
wake
to
find
he
s
a
slave
to
a
new
master
fill
that
basic
outlin
with
scene
depict
obiwan
and
anakin
go
through
adventur
and
you
d
have
a
pretti
decent
trilog
or
well
you
might
the
problem
is
not
the
basic
plot
idea
that
luca
use
the
problem
is
how
he
flesh
it
out
he
took
the
simpl
central
narr
of
the
first
three
episod
which
could
have
been
brilliant
in
the
hand
of
somebodi
who
care
about
thing
like
logic
and
coher
and
buri
it
under
sever
layer
of
shit
neglect
and
bad
act
he
made
no
appar
effort
to
screen
it
for
intern
contradict
appar
never
ask
himself
if
the
charact
were
believ
and
didn
t
bother
to
go
out
of
hi
way
to
bring
a
great
perform
out
of
the
actor
and
he
did
thi
becaus
he
is
at
hart
an
effect
man
he
love
graphic
he
want
to
build
a
wonder
and
complex
world
and
to
use
comput
graphic
to
creat
a
visual
cinemat
experi
that
wa
like
noth
seen
befor
and
he
did
that
and
brilliantli
but
in
hi
rush
to
do
that
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
neglect
the
other
half
of
the
movi
the
stori
that
tie
it
all
togeth
and
that
s
where
he
fell
apart
and
whi
i
hate
the
first
trilog
so
much
anakin
s
desper
battl
against
fate
isn
t
the
problem
it
s
that
luca
make
him
act
so
insipid
and
stupid
that
the
audienc
feel
he
turn
to
the
dark
side
becaus
he
wa
a
whini
man
bitch
and
not
becaus
he
wa
a
desper
and
brilliant
jedi
who
wa
at
heart
just
a
boy
tri
to
save
the
girl
he
love
luca
didn
t
treat
a
singl
plot
idea
he
had
with
the
respect
it
deserv
and
he
and
the
rest
of
us
paid
for
it
jame
h
i
like
your
altern
it
s
a
bit
gener
and
i
don
t
mean
that
in
a
rude
way
and
predic
on
the
idea
that
anakin
wa
kind
of
rotten
to
begin
with
but
it
s
coher
and
i
think
that
you
re
absolut
right
that
it
would
have
made
a
good
framework
for
the
first
three
episod
if
it
wa
treat
properli
i
get
the
feel
that
luca
want
to
play
up
the
tragic
hero
angl
and
that
s
whi
he
went
the
direct
he
did
but
i
do
disagre
with
you
about
one
strong
point
i
don
t
think
that
the
problem
with
star
war
i
ii
and
iii
is
the
central
narr
at
it
core
luca
script
for
episod
i
ii
and
iii
is
veri
much
the
same
as
your
own
it
s
coher
and
understand
and
could
serv
as
the
basi
for
a
great
film
but
onli
if
treat
properli
think
about
it
if
i
simplifi
the
stori
to
it
most
basic
element
we
d
get
someth
that
sound

sincenn
guess
what
disney
is
dmca
ing
next
evan
you
were
veri
bias
in
overcompl
the
pod
race
bet
it
realli
wasn
t
that
complic
sex
kamal
from
the
jerki
boy
want
hi
kissel
act
back
dan
i
think
the
worst
part
are
the
endless
drone
on
in
luke
and
vader
s
lightsab
battl
it
wa
tri
to
build
suspens
but
it
just
got
bore
and
also
i
don
t
mind
the
ewok
as
much
as
most
but
they
should
have
play
a
smaller
role
that
be
said
the
speeder
chase
in
the
forest
wa
pretti
cool
and
what
you
said
about
see
it
as
a
kid
i
saw
both
the
old
trilog
on
vh
not
the
shitti
remad
dvd
s
and
the
prequel
as
a
kid
person
i
think
that
peopl
give
the
prequel
too
much
shit
and
that
they
had
too
high
of
expect
go
into
it
also
my
person
favorit
is
esb
it
is
the
most
thought
and
conflict
one
cthulhugamet
my
onli
gripe
with
thi
the
best
review
of
thi
steam
pile
of
shit
of
a
movi
is
mo
mention
of
kurosawa
godard
or
bergman
might
be
shi
an
italian
or
two
and
i
know
he
s
an
acquir
tast
but
esp
if
your
a
painter
greenaway
s
movi
are
a
visual
candi
shop
sinc
the
disney
buyout
and
discuss
about
the
next
possibl
film
i
ve
encount
some
thru
the
eye
of
a
child
apologist
for
thi
trope
fest
just
need
a
remind
that
i
wasn
t
lose
mind
thi
is
a
terribl
movi
and
need
to
be
rememb
as
such
besid
maul
the
onli
redeem
qualiti
of
pm
is
that
compar
it
make
the
ewok
bearabl
cthulhugamet
no
mention
of
kurosawa

alex
ok
so
the
blockad
ring
the
planet
make
a
ring
around
the
planet
sorri
i
m
not
the
nativ
speaker
and
as
far
as
i
understand
one
not
give
a
shit
from
which
point
on
the
planet
they
take
off
cuz
in
space
there
s
no
up
and
down
so
whi
to
go
directli
thought
the
blockad
ring
go
abov
it
90
degre
abov
or
below
right
or
up
get
to
a
safe
distanc

it
is

jubalbigg
one
of

now
if

to
the

they
kind
of
had
step

but
step
2
wa
mostli

made

a

review
alex
now
i
see
what
who
d
made
luca
sell
hi
compani
to
disney
nice
done
darthbaneforev
im
still
a
fan
of
the
star
war
prequel
i
cant
wait
to
see
episod
7
8
and
9
orbi
but
the
ironi
is
that
even
the
special
effect
are
not
that
good
the
cgi
look
realli
fake
for
exampl
termin
2
made
10
year
befor
had
better
special
effect
than
episod
2
also
the
special
effect
are
none
near
as
ground
brake
as
the
origin
star
war
piwiat
ok
so
i
use
shazam
and
noth
came
up
what
is
the
name
of
the
song
at
the
end
of
hi
review
ninjacat
the
fact
that
the
droid
get
cut
down
like
butter
is
onli
a
problem
if
you
look
at
tpm
as
a
stand
alon
movi
and
everyon
in
the
audienc
knew
they
were
see
onli
1
3rd
of
a
trilog
1
the
seem
superior
of
the
jedi
what
make
their
eventu
fall
so
dramat
is
the
destruct
of
their
statu
as
nearli
invinc
figur
thi
ha
to
happen
out
of
order
from
the
origin
trilog
in
order
to
make
narr
sens
the
jedi
start
with
power
and
lose
to
evil
rather
than
start
as
goodi
underdog
it
s
ok
that
their
primari
oppon
are
incompet
in
the
first
movi
sinc
you
ve
alreadi
accept
that
you
are
in
for
a
trilog
fault
thi
aspect
of
the
first
film
after
the
whole
trilog
wa
a
failur
is
unfair
2
the
superior
of
the
clone
versu
droid
ever
wonder
whi
the
empir
would
bother
train
and
use
live
human
or
at

humanoid
under
those
stormtroop
outfit
rather
than
mass

a

of

i
certainli
wonder
that
as
a

thi
wa
actual
a
clever
way
to

by

the
incompet

unreli
of
the
mass

machin
and
eventu
necess

clone

queen
are
more
excit
than

the
lack

throughout

wa
the
result
of
mostli

a
long

the
fact

i
alway
thought
the
droid
were
the
protagonist
in
all
honesti
i
feel
that
way
about
all
six
movi
chuck
groin
punch
the
uruk_hai
s
uncanni
fight
abil
can
at
least
be
explain
away
through
magic
becaus
tolkien
wa
never
stupid
enough
to
make
it
work
via
microb
richter
belmont
the
prequel
are
stylist
design
to
be
that
way
but
we
can
dimish
the
effect
of
it
not
pay
to
see
the
movi
johnny_dk
i
like
the
battel
droid
jw6
you
can
ration
it
howev
you
want
but
i
am
99
5
sure
that
luca
wa
not
think
anyth
you
said
here
so
those
point
of
critic
are
total
accur
no
there
s
a
conspiraci
theori
i
heard
that
the
whole
reason
georg
made
the
prequel
is
to
show
how
shitti
the
old
republ
wa
after
the
6
th
movi
there
wa
an
invas
by
a
speci
that
turn
planet
into
organ
ship
in
a
matter
of
day
if
palpatin
knew
thi
in
advanc
then
it
d
be
freak
geniu
to
overthrow
the
republ
to
protect
it
jesu
christ
look
how
retard
both
the
senat
and
the
jedi
are
in
deal
with
a
bunch
of
fuck
retard
droid
the
empir
ha
trillion
of
troop
and
ha
a
station
that
can
blow
up
motherfuck
planet
ya
know
one
that
could
ve
been
turn
into
genocid
spaceship
but
yeah
the
sith
are
the
bad
guy
the
rebellion
just
caus
the
genocid
of
a
dozen
or
so
speci
grandam
luca
ha
a
veri
poor
track
record
with
movi
plinkett
say
that
luca
get
too
much
credit
for
star
war
and
i
agre
i
wouldn
t
trust
luca
with
ani
movi
if
i
want
it
to
be
more
than
eye
candi
you
could
say
my
idea
for
the
stori
is
similar
to
hi
but
he
doesn
t
tell
the
stori
veri
well
at
all
so
it
s
hard
to
tell
if
it
s
actual
similar
or
not
it
s
as
if
he
ad
in
so
much
crap
becaus
he
want
it
to
be
epic
it
becam
convolut
and
bog
down
with
meaningless
scene
the
first
sequel
could
be
thrown
out
entir
and
it
wouldn
t
chang
the
stori
at
all
that
is
the
problem
he
told
a
stori
that
could
fill
one
movi
spread
it
over
three
and
fill
the
void
with
pointless
action
and
visual
but
when
he
fill
the
void
he
water
down
the
stori
so
that
it
is
hard
to
follow
and
understand
zero_miles_per_hour
i
think
there
might
have
been
an
earlier
draft
where
it
s
explain
that
the
trade
feder
is
an
allianc
of
the
most
wealthi
planet
and
the
sith
are
manipul
them
through
their
greed
to
destroy
the
republ
from
within
and
padm
is
a
threat
becaus
she
s
tri
to
make
a
counter
allianc
thi
would
explain
their
name
their
robot
armi
and
their
desir
to
kill
padm
pod
such
stupid
review
zero_miles_per_hour
it
seem
to
me
like
what
they
should
have
done
is
not
make
the
jedi
avoid
romanc
instead
they
should
avoid
polit
like
they
could
make
anakin
secretli
have
a
crush
on
senat
padm
who
is
organ
a
counter
allianc
against
the
trade
feder
and
get
kidnap
by
the
apprentic
sith
becaus
palpatin
is
back
the
trade
feder
to
destroy
the
republ
from
within
so
anakin
will
agre
to
help
the
republ
save
padm
use
the
alia
darth
vader
so
the
jedi
won
t
know
but
he
s
not
power
enough
to
do
it
and
palpatin
is
drawn
by
hi
forc
and
hi
immens
rage
and
convinc
him
to
becom
hi
apprentic
with
the
promis
of
godlik
power
without
realiz
that
thi
will
result
in
the
death
of
hi
other
apprentic
and
thi
caus
anakin
to
becom
darth
vader
perman
and
also
marri
to
padm
and
worship
by
the
republ
as
their
savior
so
palpatin
decid
to
abandon
the
trade
feder
and
use
hi
new
apprentic
to
weasel
hi
way
into
the
republ
meanwhil
the
jedi
have
figur
out
the
darth
vader
thing
by
now
and
come
to
stop
it
but
anakin
person
slaughter
them
all
except
yoda
who
s
too
power
and
obi
wan
who
wa
the
onli
jedi
he
actual
knew
person
but
use
that
much
forc
in
one
battl
nearli
kill
him
so
the
republ
build
him
the
suit
and
the
two
remain
jedi
flee
and
turn
the
trade
feder
into
the
rebel
allianc
eventu
join
by
padm
who
flee
with
her
and
anakin

it

that
i
have
to
say
thi
but
i
oh
man
unsham
wow
i
never
realiz
how
bad
thi
movi
is
i
watch
it
in

with

back
then
when
it

all
i

the

with

and
they
made

i

i
would
reach

in

in

strike

wa
i
ani
differ
when
you
taught

we
have
thu
establish

taught
obi

to
be

whi
abandon
that
episod
i
should
have
been
about
yoda
discov
obi

and
train
him
to

the

tempt

it
look

but
they
are
look
out
it
at

and
see
straight
down

thi
is
probabl
the
most
educ
video
ive
ever
watch
cereu
rememb
when
jar
jar
spit
out
that
weird
shovel
head
salamand
the
thing
that
i
just
rememb
is
whi
he
spit
it
out
becaus
he
find
out
how
much
it
cost
how
doe
a
fuck
moron
from
an
insular
societi
who
ha
live
in

alon
for

understand
the

so
yeah
veri

i

the

counter
job
first
of

i
m
not
even
start
defend
the

of
phantom
menac
in
gener
it
is
a
great
movi
with
great
stori
i
ll
just
comment
your
reason
the
need
of
a
protagonist
the
audienc
need
a
protagonist
who
the
hell
told
you
that
you
are
bound
to
the
past
where
all
action
movi
follow
the
veri
same
linear
structur
repeat
over
and
over
again
due
to
lack
of
creativ
onli
1
person
and
hi
problem
fill
the
whole
pictur
the
most
stupid
thing
on
the
older
movi
wa
the
center
around
luke
nobodi
knew
shit
about
the
rest
of
the
galaxi
what
is
the
senat
where
is
it
empir
of
what
you
see
dagobah
hoth
tattoin
and
endor
and
none
of
them
ha
ani
trace
of
govern
the
onli
place
you
see
that
ha
the
slight
sign
of
administr
is
bespin
and
that
s
not
even
an
import
place
in
the
whole
galaxi
from
that
you
have
to
imagin
how
is
the
rest
of
the
galaxi
i
rememb
that
when
i
wa
a
kid
most
peopl
use
to
think
that
the
whole
empir
wa
just
an
empir
of
spaceship
that
domin
underdevelop
planet
and
that
s
all
and
the
worst
thing
is
that
accord
to
iv
v
and
vi
that
s
accept
even
more
the
whole
univers
is
at
war
but
all
you
see
is
the
adventur
of
luke
how
stupid
is
that
i
can
t
blame
luca
he
said
himself
that
he
regret
not
have
the
tech
or
money
to
make
the
stori
as
wide
as
it
should
be
at
the
time
center
on
luke
is
a
limit
not
someth
to
be
prais
the
i
ii
and
iii
right
place
the
charact
stori
below
or
at
least
in
the
same
level
as
the
rest
of
the
univers
what
should
ve
been
done
to
the
iv
v
and
vi
as
well
sorri
but
all
i
see
here
is
someon
complain
about
not
have
a
bore
1
person
stori
about
a
singl
individu
save
the
whole
univers
in
hi
everi
move
what
is
realli
ridicul
to
think
even
for
a
countri
what
to
say
for
a
whole
galaxi
i
m
realli
glad
that
luca
fix
that
and
that
now
i
can
see
that
the
whole
galaxi
is
not
made
of
1
person
descript
of
charact
i
ll
pretti
much
get
into
your
game
han
solo
he
s
a
rogu
he
got
a
strang
facial
express
and
keep
uninitent
smill
due
to
lack
of
interpret
from
h
ford
that
onli
do
seriou
role
all
of
hi
face
are
overli
express
like
he
is
do
mimic
with
too
wide
open
eye
like
japanes
theater
wich
is
great
but
total
incoher
for
a
movi
from
the
whole
cast
he
wa
the
onli
one
that
made
me
see
that
it
wa
an
actor
not
a
charact
alway
speak
as
if
there
wa
a
third
person
see
him
act
qui
gon
he
is
veri
calm
and
experienc
know
what
to
do
even
at
the
worst
time
possibl
and
is
veri
patient
everyth
is
under
hi
control
but
if
someth
isn
t
he
doesn
t
mind
break
some
rule
and
be
a
littl
rebel
if
he
think
it
s
need
for
a
greater
good
that
just
perfectli
fit
the
person
obi
wan
show
in
the
older
movi
the
onli
differ
is
that
the
old
obi
wan
is
not
a
rebel
in
ani
way
sinc
there
is
no
jedi
order
c3po
just
a
clown
noth
more
it
is
exactli
the
same
role
play
by
jar
jar
or
even
by
himself
on
the
i
ii
and
iii
amidala
veri
seriou
and
focus
person
she
can
endur
ani
hardship
with
the
same
fearless
determin
she
appear
to
have
no
feel
while
lead
her
planet
but
she
is
sweet
smart
and
corageu
when
she
is
not
in
the
rule
of
queen
os
senat
and
thi
is
great
actual
i
can
t
even
imagin
a
queen
be
ani
other
way
what
should
she
be
steric
and
stubborn
like
leia
her
imag
is
the
same
as
angela
merkel
s
or
queen
elizabeth
s
also
doe
everyon
in
your
world
must
have
a
non
regular
behaviour
somehow
mayb
you
don
t
know
seriou
peopl
but
they
do
exist
also
stop
ask
moron
what
they
think
about
the
saga
ask
someon
that
at
least
understood
the
movi
let
s
just
make
anoth
question
game
shall
we
describ
the
galaxi
in
the
2
trilog
without
describ
specif
ani
planet
i
ii
and
iii
a
bibl
of
content
iv
v
and
vi
noth
wait
hoth
stori
let
me
see
the
whole
galaxi
is
at
piec
and
you
want
a
pointless
action
scene
at
the
begin
of
phantom
menac
how
ridicul
is
that
you
want
action
at
the
begin
watch
reveng
of
the
sith
and
fill
your
eye
with
grandios
and
shame
for
ever
have
said
that
you
ve
seen
a
great
space
battl
befor
asnwer
me
thi
base
onli
in
the
iv
v
and
vi
how
doe
the
galaxi
work
what
doe
a
jedi
do
the
answer
is
silenc
becaus
there
is
noth
about
the
rest
of
the
univers
in
the
older
trilog
i
believ
you
thought
that
a
jedi
would
just
go
wherev
crime
is
and
destroy
everyon
like
a
super
hero
so
naiv
if
you
re
more
than
15yo
luca
spent
some
time
show
everyon
what
is
the
galaxi
and
what
a
jedi
do
and
all
you
can
do
is
complain
about
not
have
a
battl
go
watch
braddock
damn
it
the
i
ii
and
iii
are
so
full
of
iform
becaus
the
have
to
set
their
own
background
and
the
background
of
the
older
trilog
that
wa
so
incomplet
the
older
trilog
could
even
be
renam
to
the
space
adventur
of
luke
skywalk
and
it
would
fit
becaus
there
is
noth
els
to
the
movi
now
tri
to
do
that
to
the
new
trilog
you
can
t
and
you
know
whi
becaus
there
are
mani
import
fact
and
charact
happen
everywher
in
the
galaxi
cover
all
the
time
in
differ
take
the
movi
is
rich
the
real
star
war
can
onli
be
seen
in
the
i
ii
and
iii
becaus
the
old
movi
don
t
have
a
galaxi
onli
4
or
5
unexplor
planet
1
moon
and
some
teddi
bear
i
m
stop
here
becaus
if
i
go
on
i
ll
find
much
more
flaw
on
your
review
much
more
than
i
thought
but
at
least
i
ll
just
explain
your
point
of
view
back
in
the
70
s
80
s
scienc
fiction
wasn
t
so
explor
as
it
is
today
and
that
s
a
great
part
of
the
success
of
a
new
hope
the
whole
movi
wa
like
noth
you
ve
ever
seen
befor
the
feel
that
you
must
have
felt
when
you
saw
it
on
the
theater
must
have
been
incred
almost
imposs
to
describ
i
envi
you
for
i
ve
never
seen
those
movi
in
a
theather
sinc
i
wa
born
in
1980
unfortun
that
feel
cloud
your
judgement
becaus
you
expect
the
same
feel
in
the
new
saga
and
that
s
imposs
becaus
scienc
fiction
and
alien
are
just
a
veri
commom
subject
today
also
you
have
the
oldman
s
revolt
i
creat
the
name
but
it
is
a
veri
well
known
syndrom
where
old
peopl
desper
tri
to
enrich
their
youth
to
see
it
as
fasr
superior
to
today
s
youth
even
young
peopl
that
hate
nowaday
life
style
can
have
that
syndrom
that
make
you
love
everi
singl
piec
of
shit
from
the
past
even
flaw
and
mistak
becaus
of
that
feel
you
tend
to
say
that
everyth
that
wa
old
is
better
but
look
at
yourself
you
are
complain
about
the
new
movi
becaus
a
queen
doe
look
like
a
queen
and
a
jedi
master
doe
look
like
a
jedi
master
or
even
becaus
you
are
be
fill
with
inform
about
the
galaxi
polit
govern
speci
knowledg
that
s
just
absurd
you
prais
the
incomplet
and
despis
what
is
well
describ
i
know
thi
is
not
luca
fault
he
alreadi
said
that
he
didn
t
have
the
money
or
tech
to
make
the
old
movi
as
wide
as
they
should
be
but
limiti
are
to
be
just
respect
not
prais
so
i
tend
to
overlook
these
flaw
don
t
get
me
wrong
i
m
realli
confid
that
i
m
one
of
the
biggest
fan
star
war
will
ever
have
but
even
so
it
hard
to
let
pass
thing
like
lack
of
good
choreograph
thi
wa
respons
by
horribl
fight
between
old
kenobi
and
vader
obi
wan
look
like
an
old
man
use
a
cane
to
scare
off
a
dog
and
made
me
think
that
a
jedi
wa
a
piec
of
shit
lightsab
and
all
that
wa
not
dramat
but
a
shit
fight
also
han
shake
hi
blaster
while
shoot
is
pretti
ridicul
look
like
a
kid
say
bang
charact
breath
in
space
solo
and
crew
no
comment
lack
of
background
of
the
rest
of
the
galaxi
onli
fuck
luke
i
ve
said
enough
about
thi
alreadi
ridicul
outfit
special
those
turtl
helmet
and
the
plastic
armor
of
the
storm
trooper
now
you
have
to
learn
that
what
is
old
is
not
necessarili
good
some
thing
are
but
not
everyth
also
all
the
old
saga
wa
incomplet
and
full
of
flaw
due
to
lack
of
time
money
and
expertis
and
noth
of
that
happenend
to
the
new
saga
made
as
luca
intend
star
wa
to
be
everyth
on
the
new
movi
is
made
to
fix
the
old
oln
and
make
everyth
a
whole
with
sens
they
even
refus
to
use
cg
to
make
the
wookie
just
to
avoid
creat
a
big
gap
between
them
and
that
poorli
made
chewbacca
costum
from
the
old
saga
if
someth
is
wrong
is
in
the
old
movi
not
in
the
new
one
stop
love
crap
and
start
fundament
your
opinion
in

i
hate
to
come
out

here
be
full
of
vitriol
but
after
watch
the
funni
and
brilliant
review
for
tpm
and
then
afterward
read
some
of
the
comment
on
here
about
the
review
itself
i
have
to
say
that
so
mani
of
you
miss
the
point
of
someth
like
thi
obvious
redlettermedia
use
comed

in
these
review
mr
plinkett
is
execut
a
style
of
humor
call
satir
in
fact
one
might
even
call
it
sardon
or
cynic
or
dri
dark
humor
the
intent
of
thi
review
and
a
lot
of
other
plinkett
review
is
to
insist
upon
the
fact
that
someth
as
silli
as
a
star
war
prequel
is
complet
overtak
hi
mind
and
he
is
drive
himself
crazi
to
the
point
of
obsess
and
rumin
over
the
smallest
detail
of
the
movi
imo
there
s
a
meta
joke
hidden
in
the
charact
of
mr
plinkett
mr
plinkett
s
liter
murder
and
defens
standpoint
on
hi
own
opinion
is
iron
a
lot
like
a
stereotyp
internet
comment
s
might
be
with
that
in
mind
the
reason
whi
thi
review
end
up
be
brilliant
is
becaus
the
cynic
tone
of
the
review
unintent
point
out
a
great
deal
of
plot
hole
technic
error
and
bad
scriptwrit
that
is
present
in
the
movi
i
can
say
that
i
ve
alway
been
a
fan
of
star
war
especi
the
ot
so
i
m
bias
as
well
furthermor
it
s
impli
that
mike
s
mr
plinkett
is
a
fan
of
the
previou
movi
becaus
someon
who
hasn
t
seen
the
ot
or
who
didn
t
appreci
worship
it
wouldn
t
dedic
so
much
time
to
point
out
the
inadequaci
in
the
continu
of
such
a
belov
and
hallow
seri
of
film
if
you
ask
me
i
person
thought
tpm
wa
bore
to
me
the
onli
cool
and
interest
part
of
tpm
wa
the
lightsab
duel
between
qui
gon
obi
wan
and
darth
maul
and
that
s
onli
becaus
i
like
the
lightsab
fight
scene
in
empir
and
jedi
so
much
i
m
bias
yet
we
are
all
bias
with
us
be
the
imperfect
irrat
carbon
base
heliotrop
that
we
are
thi
bring
me
back
to
my
origin
point
these
review
are
made
for
fun
and
entertain
rlm
never
take
themselv
too
serious
and
that
s
probabl
whi
they
ve
garner
so
mani
fan
it
s
funni
becaus
it
s
absurd
that
is
the
entir
point
of
comedi
it
seem
almost
impalp
that
so
mani
peopl
choos
to
nitpick
a
cheeki
silli
interpret
of
a
terribl
movi
from
their
own
perspect
all
while
take
themselv
too
serious
thi
armchair
critic
bullshit
is
like
ask
for
a
gold
star
from
the

of

so
what

of

of

have
a
feel
that
the

in

are
just
simpl
contrari
asshol
with
noth
better
to

sound
like
what
i
ve
alway
assum
about
the
guy
he
wa
fascin
by
the
big
pictur
in
hi
head
the
first
problem
is
either
you
make
a
fiction
almanac
or
you
make
a
work
of
drama
even
if
luca
write
were
compet
plot
are
all
about
human
interest
and
pace
if
you
set
out
to
tell
a
stori
the
audienc
is
go
to
expect
a
stori
not
a
recit
of
indic
the
second
problem
is
that
luca
understand
of
hi
world
is
and
wa
alway
nebul
the

feel
like
recycl
fan

becaus
it

wa
the
spark
sure
but
hi
one
man

he
wa
noth
more
storyguy
i
have
read
some
of
suggest
for
a
differ
version
of

well
here
is
my
suggest
after
the
titl
crawl
an
organian
ship
burst
onto
the
screen
as
it
drop
out
of
hyper
space
immedi
you
can
tell
that
the
ship
is
in
distress
as
the
light
and
power
flicker
on
the
ship
and
it
is
trail

the

is

pull
up
star
chart
while
the
other
hit
buttom
to
keep
the
ship
oper
and
ask
where
did
we
end
up
the
other
explain
we
re
about
25
parsec
from
our
distinit
we
re
not
go
to
make
it
are
we
the
other
explain
without

in

in

trilog
your

didn

first
instead
of
send

i
think
the

should
be
direct
at

becaus
the

from

trilog
would
certainli

i
agre
the
prequel
are
better
in
the
fact
that
they
explain
star
war
on
a
galact
level
as
oppos
to
focus
on
just
a
few
charact
everyth
make
more
sens
with
the
addit
of
the
prequel
trilog
and
it
add
replay
valu
to
the
old
trilog
becaus
you
now
have
an
understand
of
vader
and
whi
he
doe
what
he
doe
i
person
like
both
trilog
each
for
their
own
reason
william
shakesman
i
think
you
ve
got
it
complet
backward
the
review
take
itself
extrem
serious
but
insert
comedi
constantli
to
make
it
seem
like
it
doesn
t
the
comedi
keep
you
engag
while
the
point
are
hammer
home
you
may
not
have
notic
but
your
brain
did
qui
gon
booz
even
if
true
qui
gon
die
befor
dooku
becam
evil
and
never
knew
even
then
the
other
jedi
didn
t
even
know
they
just
consid
him
a
polit
idealist
so
if
you
truli
think
that
wa
part
of
qui
gon
s
charact
then
you
ve
been
punk
qui
gon
booz
i
alway
assum
they
had
to
go
down
the
trench
becaus
there
were
too
mani
defens
turret
along
the
surfac
to
approach
from
that
direct
oddli
enough
there
were
even
turret
in
the
trench
nope
ewan
mcgregor
is
the
main
charact
as
obi
wan

i
am
confus
as
to
what

oh
by

you

do
you
just
thing
thing
you
want
should
be
free
bill
there
can
be
fire

sound

onli
for
as
far
as
the
oxygen
that
is
escap
the
space
craft
can
carri
it
smoke
ha
a
physic
properti
so
it
could
be
in

the
trajectori
of

smoke
would
move
out
in

of
differ
direct
and
would

but
it
would
still
be

it

daniel
i
wa
just
watch
menac
again
and
wa
struck
by
obi
wan
s
illog
reaction
to
their
first
encount
with
darth
maul
just
befor
they
leav
tatooin
so
obi
wan
wa
in
the
ship
expect
the
return
of
hi
master
when
suddenli
the
secur
guy
walk
in
say
qui
gon
is
in
troubl
obi
wan
then
calmli
alreadi
a
huge
mistak
walk
toward
the
windshield
and
see
a
guy
who
ha
come
out
of
nowher
carri
a
light
saber
and
attack
qui
gon
later
we
learn
at
the
jedi
council
that
the
sith
have
been
extinct
for
a
thousand
year
thu
neither
obi
wan
nor
qui
gon
have
ever
seen
one
so
what
should
be
go
through
obi
wan
s
head
when
he
saw
the
light
saber
fight
who
the
fuck
is
that
guy
i
probabl
know
him
becaus
hi
is
obvious
a
jedi
knight
but
whi
in
the
hell
would
he
attack
qui
gon
what
wa
he
do
in
the
middl
of
the
desert
to
begin
with
i
must
get
out
there
immedi
and
find
out
who
is
thi
guy
but
instead
he
sit
at
a
chair
and
say
take
off
over
there
fli
low
thi
is
probabl
the
first
time
he
ha
ever
seen
a
light
saber
duel
for
real
and
he
is
not
even
slightli
impress
by
it
daniel
anoth
thing
about
their
fight
at
tatooin
whi
doe
the
probe
have
to
return
and
report
person
to
darth
maul
couldn
t
it
just
send
a
messag
isn
t
the
point
of
have
probe
to
know
thing
without
have
to
actual
be
there
to
see
them
whi
would
darth
maul
choos
a
bike
to
get
to
their
ship
when
he
releas
the
probe
it
seem
he
just
stand
there
wait
so
i
assum
he
is
close
to
hi
ship
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
on
hi
ship
and
blow
up
the
naboo
ship
befor
it
take
off
ruin
ani
chanc
of
escap
what
if
he
get
there
in
the
exact
moment
that
they
are
leav
he
would
just
stand
there
in
the
sand
look
stupid
just
like
he
did
i
know
noth
about
script
write
but
i
think
that
if
darth
maul
got
there
in
hi
ship
just
moment
befor
they
leav
tatooin
you
could
have
a
quick
chase
scene
befor
they
jump
to
hyperspac
and
it
would
keep
the
sith
unknown
to
the
jedi
until
the
fight
sequenc
at
naboo
thi
would
fit
well
with
the
council
s
choic
of
send
just
two
guy
back
to
naboo
and
would
add
tension
to
darth
maul
s
revel
at
the
end

wa
awkward

etc
he
wa
much
more
of
an
impact
charact
when
he
wa
a
fugit
and
toss
asid
on
a
dumpi
planet
it
wa
a
much
better
way
to
show
how
hi
power
didn
t
depend
on
the
typic
trap
of
the
world
to
see
yoda
all
mix
up
with
polit
intrigu
diminish
what
made
him
such
a

and
one
is

ba
dum
tss
tai
true

i

the

wa
that
it
could
have
just
been
anakin
vs
the

sinc
that
s
the
whole
point
anyway
what
s
even
the
point
of
talk
about

stay
behind
on

on

and
wait
while
three
support
charact
do
the

he
is

who
get

sicc
on

i
think
i
have
a

of
a
problem
with
a
pretti
larg
part
of
the
way
you
re
go
about
thi
there
are
insight
throughout
but
it
seem
like
most
of
thi
is
just
point
out
plot
hole
sure
there
s
someth
to
be
said
for
plot
hole
be

to

it
seem

all
the

doe
is

them
out
it
never
explain
whi

hole
are
an

i
m
just
not
sure
it
s
fair
to
point
at
the

hole
as
flaw
in
the
movi
without
explain

there
an

i
don

doubt
for
a
second
that
they
are
in

an

in

just
point

then
they

perfect
record
of

voic
present
you
miss
the
point
entir
my
friend
so
i
ll
spell
it
out
for
you
mike
stoklasa
and
jay
bauman
are
talent
filmmak
who
make
inform
decis
when
express
their
subject
matter
present
your
thought
even
if
you
bare
have
an
ounc
of
creativ
should
mean
consid
aesthet
and
audienc
the
mode
in
which
you
present
content
can
be
as
import
to
your
point
as
what
you
say
and
from
thi
combin
the
audienc
deriv
mean
you
don
t
get
a
pizza
roll
max
okay
i
may
not
have
been
clear
and
probabl
a
bit
drunk
too
for
which
i
apolog
my
main
point
wa
not
that
it
wa
unfunni
tho
i
still
think
the
scene
in
basement
wa
useless
but
that
the
voic
made
it
realli
difficult
to
watch
it
felt
uninterest
and
bore
regardless
of
what
it
wa
say
and
hope
thi
will
let
me
avoid
deal
with
peopl
like
you
i
specif
ad
the
ps
go
ahead
and
read
it
by
the
way
second
part
wa
much
better
mayb
becaus
i
got
use
to
the
voic
but
i
still
upheld
what
i
said
befor
i
absolut
hate
the
voic
and
found
it
hard
to
focu
on
the
word
that
is
my
opinion
and
if
you
have
a
problem
with
it
well
your
problem
but
i
do
apolog
for
the
way
i
have
express
it
it
wa
a
bit
over
the
top
i
wa
just
tire
of
listen
to
someon
who
didn
t
seem
like
he
even
care
about
what
wa
he
say
sound
tire
and
bore
himself
and
so
when
it
got
to
the
basement
scene
i
could
not
hold
it
anymor
again
i
wa
quit
drunk
and
went
too
far
i
apolog
especi
sinc
the
video
doe
rais
mani
valid
point
i
just
felt
sad
it
wa
record
in
a
way
i
found
hard
to

wa
sad
too

by

they
are
talk
about

find
it
hard
to
focu
on
what
they
are

i
wish
i
could
get
away
with

can
just
say
it
s
stylist
design
to
be
that
way
andrew

what
s
so
iron
is
that
i
rememb
all
of

much
better

the

is
to

memor
usual
thi
come
from

but
can
also
come
from
write
no
charact
in
the
prequel
are
nearli
as
interest
or
memor
as
the
charact
in
the
origin
to
me
they
just
seem
like
peopl
who
do
and
say
thing
the
plot
need
them
to
say
rather
than
peopl
with
motiv
that
may
not
actual
be
the
case
but
the
problem
is
that
s
the
way
it
come
across
and
that
s
what
matter
alex
lee
anoth
ironi
is
that
by
the
charact
test
jar
jar
is
actual
one
of
the
stronger
charact
he
s
the
comic
relief
he
s
goofi
he
s
foolish
and
he
s
bumbl
when
you
compar
him

all
of

but
there
is
one
veri
short
part
of
the
movi
i
associ
with
a
feel
of
awe

that
is
in

we
basicli
took

alex
lee
after
have
to
studi
paradis
lost
i
have
to
comment
on
the
protagonist
part
it
is
consid
that
the
protagonist
in
that
poem
is
adam
but
he
doesn
t
show
up
until
book
4
out
of
12
book
up
until
then
it
wa
just
satan
tri
to
get
to
eden
and
god
s
ridicul
circuit
plan
to
give
jesu
a
chanc
to
sacrific
himself
and
all
the
event
that
happen
in
genesi
is
also
out
of
hi
control
so
i
would
say
that
the
protagonist
doesn
t
have
to
be
at
the
begin
of
the
stori
though
he
she
should
so
yeah
anakin
is
the
protagonist
in
thi
movi
eh
still
don
t
like
anakin
all
that
much
alex
lee
it
s
so
weird
too
consid
that
stormtroop
are
danger
even
though
they
keep
miss
and
don
t
shoot
that
mani
laser
either
but
the
droid
despit

most
of
the
thing
concern

are
now
just
sad
shazzbaa
no
no
think
about
it
there
s
someon
who
meet
the
jedi
and
thu
join
the
main
plot
veri
earli
on
start
out
in
kind
of
a
bad
place
in
hi
life
get
to
share
some
backstori
as
to
how
he
got
there
is
involv
in
all
the
major
event
of
the
movi
while
have
a
semi
work
understand
of
what
s
at
stake
and
whi
it
s
import
someon
who
doe
care
about
the
wellb
of
naboo
but
all
thi
jedi
adventur
stuff
is
new
to
him
someon
who
need
thing
explain
to
him
occasion
and
ha
the
arc
of
go
from
a
clumsi
out
of

outcast
to
a
hero
the
protagonist
of

bink
alex
lee
holi
shit
you
re
right
alex
lee
i
have
to
wonder
whi
not
one
ship
in
orbit
is
fire
from
the
sky
to
rain
death
on
the
gungan
armi
it
d
be
like
set
ant
on
fire
what
wa
the
point
of
deploy
an
armi
to
stop
the
gunga
if
they
could
do
that
it
s
not
like
all
the
ship
were
tri
to
defend
the
droid
control
ship
becaus
the
key
ship
is
left
alon
tapewormbik
i
also
alway
wonder
where
did
the
gungoon
get
all
their
war
equip
sinc
it
clearli
wa
design
for
on
ground
warfar
while
the
gungito
are
underwat
creatur
ye
it
look
shell
like
but
they
rode
biped
creatur
and
had
freak
catapult
so
either
the
gung
show
have
like
a
stash
of
stuff
on
the
mainland
or
they
had
to
drag
all
of
it
from
the
bottom
of
the
lake
where
they
keep
it
in
case
someon
attack
the
land
and
they
decid
to
defend
it
thu
blow
their
cover
themselv
tapewormbik
i
agre
and
it
probabl
at
some
stage
wa
total
intent
sinc
luca
wa
all
about
the
see
the
big
drama
through
eye
of
a
small

you
are
utterli
clueless
the

explain
the

by

some
of
the
greatest

ever
made
manctofu
peopl
criticis
these
review
by
state
that
the
origin
movi
also
had
plot
hole
have
miss
the
point
the
point
is
that
plot
hole
can
be
forgotten
or
skim
over
if
the
charact
and
stori
are
engag
enough
when
charact
are
sit

that
doesn

jump
around
in

after
that
it
get

harder
to

them
coupl
with

the
problem
compound
until
it

ye
i
ve
paraphras
plinkett
there
on
a
separ

read
the

it
s
becom
clear
to
me
that

someth
peopl

want

but
it
all
tie
into
one
overal
stori
you
can
rip
apart
ani

to
the

do
the
review
move
out
of
you
mom

and
get
a
real

which
is
vastli
differ
from

i
think
georg
intend
for
anakin
to
be
the
protagonist
but
by
the
point
he
appear
we
ve
lost

in

just

some
amateur
impress
of
what
a

would
look

a
7

what

befor
without

darth
sidiou
the

befor
stardom
and

what
s
worst
too
is
that
the

of
forc

like
that
it
also

look

some

of
menac
and
the
fact
that
it
a

tomz
what
is
it
with

the

the

whatsoev
is
that
qui
gon
booz
add
the

against

as
if

me
until

to

okay
so
i
said
that
i
don
t
care
about
the

anymor
but
i
m
still
disgust
whenev
i
discov
anoth
rhyme
vader
tell

that
he
is
here
tarkin
believ
that
obi
wan
sure
he
must
be

by

my
eye
are
roll
i
m
begin
to
believ
that
they
must
be
dead
by
now
destroy
what
s
left
of
them
becam
the
work
motto
for
the
product
of
attack
of
the
clone
and
reveng
of
the
sith
lucki
for
us
that
the
real
and
onli
star
war
saga
is
holi
and
immort
and
it
puriti
be
protect
by
it
fan
alex
lee
see
as
how
luca
call
the
gungan
goonga
mispronouc
that
word
doesn
t
seem
to
matter
realli
anni
stone
i
realli
love
all
the
prequel
so
much
more
than
the
old
star
war
movi
becaus
they
were
old
and
now
the
prequel
are
start
to
get
old
so
i
don
t
like
them
that
much
ani
more
admir
bone
to
pick
yeah
but
like
the
phantom
menac
paradis
lost
is
total
convolut
and
confus
and
doesn
t
make
a
lot
of
sens
if
the
phrase
plot
hole
had
exist
in
the
seventeenth
centuri
then
someon
like
plinkett
would
probabl
have
print
lengthi
pamphlet
on
the
subject
marc
magana
you
re
get
old
too
erin
d
lindsey
i
like
these
video
becaus
i
think
they
not
onli
demonstr
that
the
prequel
stori
and
charact
were
inferior
to
the
origin
trilog
but
that
the
prequel
were
inferior
on
a
technic
and
directori
level
as
well
i
think
they
help
peopl
who
may
have
had
difficulti
verbal
exactli
whi
they
didn
t
like
the
prequel
as
much
as
oppos

they

m
seriou

the

good

i
love
all
the
star
war
movi
prequel
includ
as
we
saw
the
origin
that
introduc
us
to
the
world
and
it
s
rule
with
refer
to
the
event
of
the
past
thi
meant
that
essenti
there
couldn
t
be
as
much
drama
as
we
knew
how
the
prequel
would
play
out
we
knew
the
emperor
would
take
over
and
form
the
empir
you
watch
the
prequel
to
se
just
how
that
unfold
as
for
who
is
the
main
charact
i
d
say
obi
wan
we
don
t
experi
it
through
hi
perspect
as
it
s
more
of
a
third
person
movi
but
obi
wan
ha
encount
with
everyon
els
and
even
emot
reaction
with
them
as
a
jedi
he
doesn
t
can
t
throw
out
tear
but
show
concern
out
hi
master
defi
the
council
ob
wan
is
a
by
the
book
jedi
but
also
loyalti
as
he
care
deepli
for
hi
master
seen
in
the
end
when
jinn
die
and
obi
wan
get
mad
and
aveng
him
in
what
may
be
the
best
dual
of
the
seri
he
is
worri
about
anakin
trust
the
council
s
view
that
he
is
danger
but
ultim
decid
to
train
him
becaus
it
wa
jinn
s
last
request
thi
show
an
arc
as
it
s
the
first
time
obi
wan
ha
been
will
to
defi
the
council
and
with
the
knowledg
of
the
origin
we
know
the
mistak
that
it
is
to
train
him
and
that
he
ll
be
the
death
of
the
jedi
so
we
are
see
the
begin
of
the
end
by
the
way
i
don
t
get
the
retard
voic
in
the
video
that
i
hope
is
an
act
for
the
video
and
the
mispronunci
of
protagonist
i
work
in
film
tv
as
an
editor
and
have
my
degre
in
screen
art
and
while
i
can
say
your
basic
formula
doe
suit
sic
fi
and
fantasi
best
as
we
need
a
relat
charact
to
guid
us
through
it
is
not
essenti
as
long
as
the
rule
of
the
world
are
clearli
establish
as
they
were
with
the
origin
open
titl
open
scene
then
we
have
a
context
to
put
these
charact
into
jack
brown
amen
to
that
star
trek
which
ha
alway
show
great
stori
of
new
cultur
explor
space
confront
and
racism
ha
twice
now
been
blown
up
into
a
non
sensic
two
hour
action
flick
alex
lee
i
m
go
to
treat
thi
comment
as
if
it
isn
t
troll
for
the
sake
of
argument
obi
wan
doesn
t
do
anyth
in
thi
movi
though
he
s
in
the
background
follow
order
and
that
mean
he
can
t
be
the
main
charact
in
thi
stori
becaus
he
isn
t
realli
interact
with
other
charact
qui
gonn
doe
qui
gonn
s
the
one
that
make
the
plan
make
suggest
and
perform
most
of
the
action
especi
when
it
come
to
anakin
in
the
movi
obi
wan
doe
none
of
these
thing
and
he
bare
react
to
the
world
around
him
becaus
he
s
on
the
ship
or
drive
the
submarin
or
someth
there
s
also
the
fact
that
qui
gonn
get
the
most
screen
time
of
ani
charact
in
the
movi
now
i
get
the
feel
that
luca
wa
write
a
sanjuro
charact
for
those
who
never
saw
yojimbo
or
sanjuro
thi
charact
wa
a
beard
conniv
master
swordsman
who
wa
secret
about
hi
feel
and
help
the
weak
in
a
weird
and
roundabout
way
the
reason
whi
sanjuro
work
but
qui
gonn
doesn
t
is
that
the
use
of
the
term
knight
impli
nobil
honesti
and
forthrighted
thi
problem
is
further
compound
by
the
inher
dualiti
of
the
star
war
univers
where
good
and
evil
are
pretti
clearli
defin
in
contrast
yojimbo
and
sanjuro
are
a
littl
bit
fuzzier
on
the
subject
and
certainli
wasn
t
one
of
the
main
theme
of
those
movi
anyway
craigerz

jason
by
the
way
i
don
t
get
the
retard
voic
in
the
video
that
i
hope
is
an
act
for
the
video
and
the
mispronunci
of
protagonist
prove
that
the
onli
peopl
who
enjoy
the
prequel
are
mental
infant
he
is
someon
who
is
at
a
constant
struggl
with
himself
what
when
he
just
seem
to
do
whatev
he
want
with
a
complet
blas
attitud
if
there
s
an
intern
struggl
it
is
at
no
point
shown
in
the
movi
the
onli
charact
trait
the
movi
realli
give
ginni
is
that
he
like
to
take
the
easi
way
out
whenev
possibl
whether
it
s
mind
trick
someon
into
give
him
an
underwat
craft
or
use
the
forc
to
cheat
on
a
dice
roll
even
when
he
fight
darth
maul
it
come
off
not
as
an
act
of
courag
but
as
an
act
of
hubri
he
doesn
t
think
he
can
lose
and
if
he
actual
thought
for
a
second
he
might
lose
he
d
have
probabl
mind
trick
someon
els
into
fight
for
him
if
anyth
ginni
act
more
like
a
sith
than
a
jedi
manipul
peopl
and
situat
to
hi
person
advantag
which
btw
would
ve
been
a
much
more
interest
and
subtl
charact
arc
than
anyth
in
the
prequel
dudley
hey
come
on
now
i
don
t
agre
with
the
guy
but
that
s
harsh
dudley
i
hadn
t
watch
thi
in
a
long
time
and
rewatch
it
now
it
s
amaz
how
much
thi
a
critic
of
a
movi
hold
up
as
entertain
certainli
more
so
than
the
soporif
prequel
one
aspect
in
which
i
d
disagre
from
plinkett
is
in
the
idea
that
these
movi
have
ruin
star
war
i
still
like
those
movi
the
origin
one
about
as
much
now
as
i
did
befor
the
phantom
menac
exist
actual
i
might
appreci
them
more
now
then
i
did
then
but

a
refund
my
friend
your
time
in
class
wa
wast
if
you
think
thi
thing
qualifi
in
anyway
as
film
you
are
actual
argu
that
thi
movi
wa
better
off
without
a
relat
charact
and
claim
that
there
is
some
context
to
thi
collect
of
imag
and
sound
effect
meant
to
capit
on
more
success
stori
also
you
are
dead
wrong
peopl
didn
t
come
to
the
prequel
to
watch
the
stori
unfold
they
came
for
the
same
reason
we
went
to
see
the
origin
film
to
be
entertain
and
in
hope
that
the
interest
world
luca
creat
could
be
expand
if

just
want
to
see
how
the
stori
unfold
all
you
need
to
do
wa
listen
to
old
obi
wan
in

and
return
of

becaus
like
it
or
not
guest
these
movi
were
not
about
obi
wan
they
are
about
darth
vader
period
the
whole
point
of
these
film
wa
to
show
vader
be
creat
everyth
els
is
a
slap
on
plot
devic
to
get
to
tatooin
pick
up
anakin
and
make
him
into
vader
thi
wa
a
total
and
complet
failur
of
a
film
the
follow
two
movi
were
just
as
bad
here
s
what
i
think
you

somewher
around
20
25
year
old
and
were
a

when
these
film
came
out
you
were

old
enough
to
be
amaz
by

over

next
six
year
you
convinc
yourself
that
thi
wa
your

epic
film
star
war
wa
ground
break
empir
is
the
basi
by
which
all
sequel
would
forev
be
judg
jedi
wa
okay
but
at
least
tie
togeth
the
act
of
the
stori
you
defend
thi
film
becaus
as

rais
in

cockpuppet
also
you
re
a
twat
for
say
retard
as
a
pejor
oh
and
for
not
recogn
obviou
joke
fuckstick
thi
meant
that
essenti
there
couldn
t
be
as
much
drama
as
we
knew
how
the

we

the

you

the
prequel
to
se
just
how
that

just
like
there
couldn
t
be
much

in
a

call
titan
becaus
we

how
the

would
play

we
knew
the

would
hit
an
iceberg
and
sink
into
the

with
most
of
it

oh
wait
you
see
there
is
a
genr
call
tragedi
in
which
the
audienc
usual
know
ahead
of
time
what
kind
of
tragic
event
is
go
to
occur
but
the
stori
is
still
worth
the
tell
becaus
of
how
the
charact
are
written
and
portray
to
see
just
how
that
unfold
are
the
prequel
documentari
i

and
the
grand

it
s
onli
after
they
assess
the

that
they
recogn
the
flaw
in

and
got
worri
to
the
point
of
want
to
evacut
they
didn

know
about
it

and
it
s
safe
to
assum
the

had
some

with
also
what
about
the
fuckin
clone

their
so
goddamn
stupid
as
oppos
to
the
complet
useless
and
equal
stupid
droid
of
the

or
ani
oppos
armi
forc
in

movi
ever
made
if
they
were

compet
the
hero
would
die
in

and
there
would
be
no

howww
are
they
gonna
lose

the

way
the

hale
exhaust

are
a
pretti
basic
part
of

and
you
wouldn

want
to
cover
those
up

when
you
diss

you
diss

http

steve
the
fish
pretti
true
although
luca
believ
that
america
lost
to
the
ingenu
of
the
north
vietnames
and
reflect
that
with
the
ewok
the
real
problem
is
that
america
fought
the
war
on
the
enemi
s
term
instead
of
target
the
enemi
s
infrastructur
and
bomb
the
railway
munit
dump
etc
we
just
had
american
soldier
wander
around
the
forest
get
ambush
and
kill
much
like
the
stormtroop
while
luca
may
believ
that
victori
wa
due
to
the
viet
kong
s
ingenu
it
wa
actual
the
result
of
america
s
incred
stupid
lbj
and
macnamera
should
burn
in
hell
for
how
they
ineptli
drag
that
war
out
just
to
profit
off
the
soldier
elcamino
the
weird
thing
is
that
keira
knightley
wa
cast
as
one
of
queen
hotpantspadm
s
decoy
jonathan
martinez
luke
is
protect
by
the
forc
and
that
total
compens
the
fact
that
he
is
a
new
pilot
so
he
get
a
special
shield
right
i
dont
think
that
how
the
forc
work
plo
koon
got
taken
down
while
he
wa
fli
and
he
is
strong
with
the
forc
and
it
wa
a
damn
clone
who
took
him
down
the
damn
torpedo
look
like
slow
move
lazer
_
about
the
death
star
what
is
thi
the
twenti
first
centuri
such
structur
should
be
extrem
formid
and
not
have
direct
acc
to
the
core
sure
the
other
ship
are
like
mosquito
so
they
didnt
worri
but
if
you
built
such
a
huge
thing
protect
the
interior
is
the
first
thing
you
do
about
the
droid
some
droid
do
pose
a
threat
mayb
not
toward
jedi
but
toward
other
yea
and
a
lot
the
clone
trooper
in
the
origin
arent
a
threat
to
absolut
no
one
the
guy
that
made
thi
review
is
expect
realism
from
the
movi
what
if
we
expect
realism
from
the
origin
than
we
got
a
problem
so
fuck
the
guy
who
made
the
review
ultim
thi
is
a
matter
of
when
wa
star
war
a
part
of
your
childhood
for
me
the
prequel
were
a
part
of
my
childhood
jonathan
martinez
lol
exhaust
vent
for
that
particular
gener
is
the
death
star
power
by
combust
chamber
by
fuel
alberto
the
star
war
prequel
were
also
part
of
my
childhood
i
love
the
phantom
menac
when
i
wa
a
kid
and
look
forward
enorm
to
episod
ii
and
iii
see
the
film
open
the
door
to
the
rest
of
the
rest
of
the
trilog
and
other
film
in
gener
i
still
watch
the
six
movi
regularli
and
enjoy
do
so
but
at
the
same
time
i
find
the
origin
trilog
much
more
involv
and
compel
the
use
of
practic
effect
and
real
life
set
play
a
role
in
make
it
feel
more
real
and
immedi
but
the
overal
develop
of
the
stori
charact
and
dialogu
are
a
much
more
signific
factor
it
isn
t
so
much
that
they
are
complex
and
complet
plausibl
human
be
but
that
we
relat
to
their
motiv
escap
from
one
s
own
place
of
origin
and
overcom
an
overwhelm
tyrann
forc
is
a
recurr
theme
in
luca
s
work
visibl
in
the
two
non
star
war
featur
luca
direct
there
are
trace
of
it
in
the
prequel
in
the
charact
of
anakin
skywalk
but
luca
shot
himself
in
the
foot
by
deliber
invok
a
world
that
isn
t
as
black
and
white
in
it
moral
i
have
constantli
tri
to
relat
to
anakin
s
transform
and
find
it
compel
in
theori
much
less
so
in
execut
hi
film
s
relianc
on
cgi
creat
vast
and
pretti
landscap
but
don
t
have
the
same
dramat
effect
as
the
use
of
light
more
thi
effect
is
more
limit
it
ultim
boil
down
to
one
s
own
opinion
and
the
argument
they
defend
them
with
a
good
case
could
be
made
in
favor
of
the
prequel
as
well
as
a
case
against
the
origin
trilog
though
i
haven
t
found
a
wholli
convinc
one
yet
becom
irat
becaus
the
death
star
ha
a
vulner
point
or
becaus
luke
s
ship
is
never
taken
down
is
nitpick
and
aren
t
valid
reason
to
take
down
an
entir
film
they
are
well
known
narr
trope
from
the
genr
that
inspir
luca
to
write
the
film
in
the
first
place
of
cours
luke
isn
t
go
to
get
shot
down
he
s
the
main
charact
and
unless
the
death
star
is
power
by
some
sort
of
perpetu
motion
machin
which
is
imposs
in
practic
scientif
term
it
need
some
sort
of
fuel
to
oper
there
are
great
film
that
have
small
inconsist
if
not
outright
plot
hole
plinkett
doe
hi
fair
share
of
nitpick
and
point
out
inconsist
but
hi
overal
argument
is
the
same
that
the
film
doesn
t
evok
the
same
emot
connect
that
the
origin
film
did
if
you
realli
like
the
prequel
thi
may
not
chang
your
mind
and
i
don
t
want
to
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
point
of
thi
kind
of
analyt
exercis
and
ani
review
in
gener
is
not
to
chang
your
opinion
but
to
exhibit
the
author
s
opinion
and
hope
it
encourag
further
reason
discuss
on
a
certain
topic
so
don
t
attack
the
peopl
express
opinion
that
you
disagre
with
and
pleas
find
a
more
coher
and
courteou
way
of
express
yourself
have
a
nice
day
http

hale
yeah
like
most
machin
i
d
figur
it
would
need
some
type
of
fuel
and
a
way
to
let
out
the
exhaust
from
said
fuel
i
mean
onli
a
total
moron
would
have
troubl
grasp
such
a
simpl
concept
http

hale
they
were
part

too
but
at

i
grew
up
and

you

wait
you
said
that
harri
s
plinkett
alex

the
best
thing
about
the
phantom
menac
is
that
you
can
forget
everyth
that
happen
in
it
and
it
won
t
affect
the
prequel
in
the
slightest
ii
and
iii
are
unfortun
necessari
to
the

trilog
jonathan

lol
so
the
death

is
power
by
fossil
fuel
no
way
jonathan
martinez
thank
you
for
your
repli
but
you
cant
deni
how
awkward
the
act
wa
in
the
origin
especi
leia
im
not
say
the
prequel
had
greater
act
but
they
were
more
seriou
make
me
believ
it
wa
real
scenario
about
cgi
or
practic
effect
cgi
is
much
better
im
just
use
to
modern
film
at
thi
point
anoth
point
that
i
hadn
t
brought
up
yet
is
the
light
saber
duel
oh
boy
did
i
cring
when
i
saw
them
in
the
origin
the
best
light
saber
duel
are
all
in
episod
3
and
portray
the
jedi
and
the
sith
is
imensli
import
for
me
jonathan
martinez
sureley
filter
exist
by
than
lol
valou999
i
quit
liter
facepalm
and
groan
when
you
said
cgi
or
pratic
effect
cgi
is
much
better
thi
is
where
you
can
truli
see
the
immens
gap
between
the
older
and
the
newer
gener
i
then
groan
even
more
when
you
ad
the
best
light
saber
duel
are
all
in
episod
3
clearli
all
hope
is
lost
with
the
new
gener
how
is
45
minut
of
emotionless
and
tediou
choreograph
stunt
pirouett
and
sword
clash
even
qualifiy
as
a
good
duel
is
beyond
my
comprehens
for
one
it
complet
lack
grit
due
to
the
cleaness
of
the
choreographi
but
more
importantli
ani
emot
build
up
you
had
lead
up
to
thi
point
evapor
after
just
the
first
30
sec
stretch
the
duel
out
for
so
long
is
onli
overindulg
and
complet
useless
as
it
onli
serv
to
emot
disconnect
you
from
the
charact
and
the
scene
the
duel
in
the
origin
were
briefer
and
work
way
better
for
it
the
best
exampl
is
the
luke
and
vader
duel
at
the
end
of
rotj
luke
get
piss
and
just
wail
on

at

everyth
is

you

everyth
you
had
to
understand
from

from
just
that
what

you
do
that
i

you
ll
have
succeed
in

the

i
have
seen
the
parodi

of

guy
too
glad
to
meet
a

silhouetteman
the
fact
that
you
re
tri
to
bash
the
origin
trilog
by
list
a
bunch
of
plot
hole
show
that
you
have
complet
miss
the
point
of
these
review
the
point
be
that
the
origin
trilog
is
one
of
the
better
exampl
of
classic
meat
and
potato
storytel
in
modern
cinema
while
the
prequel
trilog
fail
at
storytel
101
in

everi

the

basher
are
focus
on
technic
detail
such
as
no

whi
an

etc
the
differ
and
the
point
clearli
made
in

is
that
the
newer

fail
on
a
fundament

basher
don

is

the

damn
that

dennett316
the

not
just
from
jake
lloyd
everi
singl
actor
involv
in
these
movi
put
in
their
worst
career
perform
bar
none
and
that
is
due
to
the
insipid

and
the
aw
direct
of
mr
luca
ewan
mcgregor
liam
neeson
samuel
l

all
absolut
top

actor
and
all
thoroughli
terribl
in

cgi
vs

ugh
there
is
great
cgi
and
terribl
practic
effect
both
are
just
tool
like
ani
other
in
these
prequel
the
cgi
is
over
abund
and
not
of
a
realist
standard
even
for
the
time
jurass
park
came
out
6
year
befor
phantom
menac
and
the
cgi
in
that
movi
is
top
class
blend
well
with
the
frame
blend
seamlessli
with
the
top
qualiti
practic
effect
on
display
and
add
to
the
epic
scale
of
that
film
the
cgi
in
the
prequel
look
cartooni
and
succe
in
make
everyth
look
steril
and
fake
becaus
the
real
actor
stand
out
from
the
frame
thank
to
the
prolif
cg
the
best
light
sabr
duel
is
actual
from
phantom
menac
at
least
the
best
on
a
technic
and
direct
level
anyway
it
wa
actual
somewhat
excit
the
soundtrack
help
immens
and
had
the
brilliant
skill
of
ray
park
to
make
it
thrill
but
emot
the
scene
wa
dead
even
when
qui
gon
die
and
obi
wan
wa
supposedli
angri
he
look
angri
and
then
went
into
the
flounci

straight
away
and
there
wa
no
emot
to
it
i
notic
in
anoth
comment
of
your
that
you
dismiss
the
motion
of
the
origin
duel
and
that
realli
reveal
the
differ
in
audienc
nowaday
they
don
t
care
if
it
mean
anyth
they
just
want
some
whizz
bang
effect
and
loud
nois
to
distract
them
for
5
minut
action
for
the
sake
of
it
is
bore
it
ha
to
have
mean
or
a
sens
of
consequ
and
believ
in
order
to
have
ani
impact
or
be
excit
all
the
flash
and
cg
in
the
world
doesn
t
chang
the
fact
that
the
action
in
the
transform
movi
is
just
not
as
excit
as
anyth
that
happen
in
the
origin
die
hard
movi
just
as
all
the
stupid
cgi
slapstick
in
the
action
scene
of
the
prequel
doe
noth
to
even
come
close
to
the
origin
attack
on
the
death
star
despit
those
effect
be
so
much
more
primit
there
s
also
more
to
the
jedi
or
sith
than
their
light
sabr
fight
that
you
focu
on
that
as
portray
those
charact
say
all
we
need
to

i
actual
prefer

in

more
than
the

each

ha
some

you
can
actual

serv

the

and
build
a
littl
tension
from
the

rather
more

thi
reflect
luca
appreci

they

i

oh

just
pleas
think
it

just

rocki

disregard

v
in
fact
if
they
could
go
out
of

to
contradict
the

like
show
the
stormtroop
were
not
clone
or
have
old
footag
of

that
look
noth
like
the
anakin
from
the

that
would
be
amaz
jason
one
thing
i
would
chang
about

that
the

i
advis
you
not
to
watch
best
of
the
worst
plinkett
cartoon
random
side
video
and
especi
half
in
the
bag
becaus
those
show
will
all
suck
ass
compar
to
plinkett
is
probabl
what
you
will
think
at
first
but
then
you
ll
eventu
get
through
all
100
half
in
the

episod
all
the
side
stuff
fall
in
love
with

evan
and
still
keep
ask
yourself
when
the
fuck
rlm
is
go
to
releas
a
new
goddamn
mr
plinkett
video
but
i
digress
you
may
choos
the
red
pill
or
the
blue
pill
or
in
thi
case
the
real
plinkett
or
the
fake
plinkett
pissernacht
call
me
a
weird
guy
and
all
but
that
thought
make
me
so
happi
i
want
to
how
to
put
thi
i
guess
i
ll
tri
to
describ
my
mental
imageri
i
see
myself
touch
the
sun
bring
it
to
my
chest
where
it
enter
me
like
a
pilot
into
a
mech
afterward
it
then
drive
me
into
a
fight
against
the
forc
of
dark
as
if
thi
wa
evangelion
and
then
i
choke
zombi
mecha
hitler
with
my
dick
doe
that
make
sens
caus
it
s
go
to
take
me
awhil
to
sort
thi
through
at
ani
rate
it
need
to
happen
sonofwil
it
would
take
at
least
2
great
movi
from

to
even
begin
to
obscur
the

you
that

there
is

all

the

to

the

of
the

order
etc
there
s
not
much
left
for
disney
to
even
begin
with
that
said
i
still
hope
you
re
right
sonofwil
the
forc
is
what
give
a
jedi
hi
power
it
s
an
energi
field
creat
by
all
live
thing
it
surround
us
and
penetr
us
it
bind
the

togeth
obi
wan
it
is
said
that
certain
creatur
are
born
with
a
higher
awar
of

their

are
differ
they
have
more
midi
chlorian
in
their
cell
georg
luca
establish
guidelin
for
the
expand
univers
in
1977
i
see
a
direct
contradict
luca
is
claim
that
midi
chlorian
make
peopl
more
awar
of
the
forc
ignor
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
all
live
thing
are
not
just
pervad
by
the
forc
at
all
time
but
they
actual
creat
the
forc
themselv
make
it
downright
silli
to
think
there
would
be
greater
or
lesser
degre
of
awar
of
someth
so
ubiquit
the
main
contradict
in
these
quot
is
that
obi
wan
directli
get
hi
power
from
the

he
doesn
t
mention
the
aspect
of
awar
at
all
when
it
s
later
state
that
such
awar
of
the
forc
is
the
onli
real
differ
in
a
jedi
s
abil
the
most
offens
thing
about
midi
chlorian
is
that
as
outlin
by
obi
wan
and
yoda
the
forc
ha
counterpart
in
mani
mystic
tradit
lumin
be
are
we
not
thi
crude
matter
fuck
you
luca
cabbo
rememb
that
the
main
point
of
these
review
is
not
to
show
plot
hole
caus
by
over
fantast
scienc
fiction
the
charact
and
their
action
are
complet
broken
in
the
prequel
no
one
ha
a
clear
motiv
or
is
abl
to
act
on
a
motiv
without
do
someth
stupid
beg
for
realist
charact
is
complet
justifi
and
if
we
do
the
same
with
the

we
d
be
complet
satisfi
ye
you
can
nit
pick
over
the
minutia
of
some
of
the
more
sci
fi
element
of
the
origin
trilog
the
problem
discuss
in
these
review
aren
t
just
littl
point
about
the
fantasi
they
show
the
crack
run
throughout
the
entireti
of
the
prequel
seri
addit
even
if
the
origin
trilog
wa
terribl
how
doe
that
justifi
the
aw
of
the
prequel
i
know
that
thi
review
speak
to
how
they
ve
ruin
the
star
war
franchis
but
if
you
take
that
out
then
all
the
neg
that
lead
to
that
conclus
still
stand
on
their
own
whi
defend
the
prequel
by
say
that
the
origin
trilog
is
bad
rather
than
that
the
prequel
are
good
even
if
you
ve
got
nostalgia
for
them
you
should
still
be
abl
to
realis
that
they
re
aw
cabbo
if
these
realli
are
your
opinion
then
you
re
either
tri
far
far
too
hard
to
justifi
the
prequel
in
your
own
mind
or
you
have
no
futur
in

jason
the
prequel
are
non
canon
they
were
made
by
some
hack
fraud
who
didn
t
understand

even

make
for
that

the

thi

been
good
he
wa
just
so
over
the
top
bad
that
all
the
other
more
subtli
bad
thing
in
the
movi
seem
good
by
comparison
it
wasn
t
until
the
second
and
third
movi
which
had
less

thi
is
realli
dark
humor
mijk
hey
i
just
stumbl
over
thi
nice
convers
here
plu
point
for
us
rlm
fan
no
one
ha
threaten
jm
with
rape
or
anyth
there
might
still
be
some
good
in
us
also
no
one
quot
plinkett
show
him
how
stupid
he
is
but
consid
hi
argument
which
is
a
good
think
so
i
ll
join
in
to
thi
bottomless
comment
section
bash
the
origini
is
okay
and
i
even
think
your
point
are
valid
the
exhaust
pipe
thing
wa
a
bit
simplist
and
wa
use
to
wrap
up
thing
of
enorm
proport
pretti
quick
luke
didn
t
get
hit
he
just
doesn
t
what
a
lucki
guy
not
the
onli
one
in
movi
histori
certainli
a
lot
of
lucki
padm
anakain
obi
wan
in
the
prequel
as
well
but
nevermind
that
what
i
rather
can
support
is
to
defend
the
prequel
not
everi
point
plinkett
make
is
undebat
true
also
i
find
nitpick
is
a
nice
thing
which
one
can
appli
to
everi
movi
especi
your
favourit
one
it
doesn
t
ruin
the
movi
it
just
make
you
wonder
about
it
again
you
don
t
forget
them
and
that
is
a
good
thing
at
least
with
good
movi
all
in
all
plinkett
is
right
even
in
hi
first
statement
thi
movi
wa
sooo
dissapoint
i
wa
22
when
i
hit
the
theatr
in
1999
and
these
movi
weren
t
made
for
me
and
my
age
perhap
but
i
wa
will
to
forgiv
a
lot
i
still
do
so
defend
the
prequel
is
a
veri
hard
job
i
would
like
to
see
a
witti
person
make
a
counter
review
to
plinkett
here
and
for
the
record
say
someth
like
well
you
don
t
like
my
favourit
movi
i
think
your
star
war
is
an
asshol
too
doesn
t
count
as
witti
so
what
is
there
to
like
i
also
don
t
think
all
cg
is
bad
naboo
look
incred
i
like
the
royal
starship
and
darth
maul
ship
as
an
inuendo
to
later
tie
fighter
i
like
the
hippi
like
jedi
qui
gon
jinn
he
becam
the
first
jedi
spirit
and
that
touch
upon
some
sort
of
lore
i
would
like
to
hear
more
about
subtleti
in
contemporari
movi
is
not
onli
lack
it
is
process
to
camp
4
so
i
wonder
how
veri
subtl
thi
whole
thing
play
out
in
the
prequel
the
jedi
order
wa
flaw
befor
their
extinct
but
even
though
they
sort
of
knew
about
thi
there
wasn
t
a
final
statement
like
yoda
say
oh
it
all
went
to
bit
becaus
we
haven
t
done
anyth
we
must
learn
more
about
the
forc
like
that
wick
new
spirit
thing
qui
gon
recent
got
into
whi
did
yoda
have
to
go
into
exil
after
break
up
the
fight
against
palpatin
if
he
did
so
for
becom
wiser
and
rethink
thi
whole
jedi
and
the
forc
thing
couldn
t
they
at
least
say
so
but
i
want
to
point
out
good
thing
in
the
prequel
i
don
t
mind
jar
jar
he
wa
an
idiot
charact
for
sure
but
they
got
rid
of
him
mostli
even
in
episod
2
and
i
don
t
consid
ani
of
these
film
superior
to
episod
1
jake
lloyd
wa
a
kid
in
a
star
war
movi
he
wa
fli
and
shoot
and
say
some
thing
i
don
t
mind
him
either
i
even
prefer
him
to
hi
later
incarn
becaus
he
wasn
t
evil
all
the
time
ye
lloyd
anakin
wa
a
nice
help
boy
and
introduc
us
also
to
thi
young
padawan
thing
which
got
a
dark
pay
off
in
the
end
palpatin
plan
well
that
is
a
biiig
nitpick
right
there
it
is
hard
to
look
past
the
huuug
flaw
of
thi
plan
and
the
crazi
coincid
that
need
to
happen
to
make
him
the
emperor
in
the
end
but
even
that
i
am
abl
to
forgiv
it
is
like
luka
and
vader
in
the
death
star
trench
veri
lucki
i
don
t
mind
inclus
of
jabba
or
most
of
the
other
charact
sinc
it
wasn
t
more
than
a
nod
includ
c
3po
and
chewbacca
wa
pretti
stupid
but
at
least
r2
origin
wa
handl
nice
well
i
can
go
on
and
on
still
after
all
these
year
but
just
a
last
word
for
jonathan
martinez
here
i
also
don
t
hate
the
lightsab
duel
of
the
prequel
they
don
t
need
to
be
overload
with
emot
the
littl
emot
the
prequel
duel
convey
wa
enough
for
me
i
at
least
understood
their
motiv
but
sinc
you
were
go
soo
into
detail
about
everi
move
darth
maul
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
made
dure
their
battl
you
might
be

jonathan
martinez
oh
we
were
just
have
a
small
convers
thank
you
for
your
insight
repli
i
saw
the
video
veri
interest
perhap
there
are
no
movi
to
depict
light
saber
duel
well
enough
even
in
the
origin
ben
kenobi
vs
vader
it
look
like
they
were
fenc
at
a
veri
slow
pace
i
pick
darth
maul
vs
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
as
an
exampl
for
emot
and
had
explain
the
reason
of
that
battl
outcom
the
video
you
sent
me
demontr
how
the
director
fail
in
some
fight
choreagraphi
nontheless
it
wa
excit
for
me
that
is
perhap
i
should
have
focus
on
the
duel
in
episod
3
anakin
vs
obi
wan
that
could
have
well
been
the
best
duel
in
the
entir
movi
seri
in
conclus
i
like
innov
and
new
idea
sinc
mani
believ
the
duel
were
so
good
in
the
origin
should
they
have
done
similar
duel
in
the
prequel
i
dont
think
so
movi
have
to
be
made
to
convinc
me
to
think
what
they
re
do
is
real
akeuw
the
fight
in
these
movi
are
just
ridicul
it
is
like
the
romantic
sword
fight
versu
a
real
one
in
the
real
one
they
go
side
to
side
tri
to
hit
past
the
shield
there
are
no
overhead
hit
becaus
that
would
expos
the
fighter
same
with
the
prequel
there
are
dozen
of
opportun
for
the
fighter
to
hit
say
the
leg
and
they
are
not
taken
d
man
two
minut
of
mindless
duel
doesn
t
make
up
for
the
other
hour
of
horribl
travesti
plinkett
highlight
that
you
appar
complet
miss
you
have
no
ground
to
stand
on
it
ha
noth
to

with

ruin
my
childhood
they
are
just
terribl
made
movi
in

and
deserv
to
be
out
as
such
jrg7777
but
i
wa
go
to
toshi
station
to
pick
up
some
power
convert
at

the

did
a
good

show

diehounderdoggen
it
wa
the
most
3d
3d
movi
i
ve
ever
seen
in

i
think
other
3d

film
in

don
t
even
compar
to
the
3d
ness
of
thi
3d

of

award
for

3d
work

nautonni
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is
that
luca
seem
to
like
to
think
up
set
piec
and
then
he
retrofit
a
stori
around
them
somewher
els
on
the
internet
there
is
a
transcript
with
luca
spielberg
and
lawrenc
kasdan
discuss
idea
about
raider
of
the
lost
ark
it
show
that
luca
wa
a
bit
of
a
mook
even
back
then
it
also
demonstr
whi
empir
wa
so
awesom
becaus
kasdan
can
bring
it
proper
seniorpep
i
feel
as
though
you
don
t
know
what
he
meant
by
emotionless
yeah
they
meant
someth
as
a
part
of
the
emot
whole
but
there
s
so
much
movement
flash
light
and
obvious
and
awkwardli
becaus
of
it
choreograph
fight
there
s
no
room
to
show
their
emot
at
the
time
lightsab
are
also
overus
here
i
don
t
rememb
if
he
brought
that
up
in
thi
review
or
hi
episod
ii
review
alex
lee
one
minor
note
about
the
fear
lead
to
anger
part
the
largest
problem
moreso
than
the
interchang
state
is
that
littl
boy
anakin
ha
never
realli
express
neg
emot
the
onli
thing
jake
lloyd
did
adequ
is
be
happi
go
lucki
the
entir
movi
the
point
of
that
scene
is
to
show
us
anoth
side
to
anakin
but
it
fail
becaus
that
scene
doesn
t
realli
chang
him
as
a
person
he
doesn
t
get
angri
or
cri
or
anyth
instead
he
goe
right
back
to
be
happi
go
lucki
so
it
s
not
ani
wonder
whi
we
find
him
so
irrit
robert
eckert
captain
panaka
some
charact
i
can
t
even
describ
insid
their
role
robert
eckert
it
doesn
t
appear
you
understood
what
hulk
wa
get
at
then
hulk
is
say
that
the
primari
purpos
of
the
plot
howev
much
logic
the
plot
ha
or
fail
to
have
is
to
understand
the
develop
of
the
charact
plinkett
is
point
out
that
the
plot
hole
here
are
of
that
particularli
ruinou
kind
which
make
the
charact
action
random
and
unmotiv
so
that
we
cannot
care
what
they
do
or
what
happen
to
them
alex
lee
he
s
a
captain
that

it

sydneydud
aussi
plinkett
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
these
review
lol
these
prequel
are
the
result
of
luca
not
have
other
movi
and
stori
to
rip
off
thi
time
around
he
s
been
expos
as
the
fraud
he
is
who
rode
in
on
the
tailcoat
of
the
other
who
actual
pull
togeth
and
made
the
origin
trilog
while
he
wa
given
a
lollipop
and
told
to
sit
in
a
corner
with
hi
star
war
doll
starcrunch
dead
on
i
think
georg
luca
ha
thi
idea
of
someth
realli
cool
that
s
go
to
happen
and
then
write
hi
stori
to
fit
that
cool
thing
in
it
s
not
the
worst
idea
plenti
of
writer
do
the
same
thing
but
when
you
are
tri
to
incorpor
some
byzantin
intrigu
and
labyrinthin
plot
it
realli
doesn
t
work
starcrunch
i
m
not
confus
jake
lloyd
or
hayden
christensen
for
that
matter
with
a
good
actor
but
no
one
and
i
mean
no
one
save
thi
poorli
conceiv
anakin
the
reason
you
say
he
adequ
portray
happi
go
lucki
is
becaus
that
s
the
onli
thing
given
to
him
you
could
have
had
the
best
child
actor
out
there
and
it
would
have
been
the
same
the
problem
is
the
write
long
befor
the
cast
even
get
consid
mitchel
taco
nash
when
s
the
next
episod
i
plinkett
review
mitchel

they
need
to

thi

alreadi
to
diminish
the
effect
of

david

it
break
my
heart
to
tell
you
thi
but
you
are
right
mr
plinkett
and
i
admir
your
honesti
i
don
t
think
that
georg

i

it
s
stylist
design
to
be

i
e
kind
of
bigger

familiar

so
the

get
the

son
what
a
classic
line
stardog
champion
the
thing
hate
about
episod
1
wa
the
charact
their
realli
wa
no
interest
charact
on
top
of
that
the
stori
and
dialogu
wa
so
bore
their
some
uniqu
element
in
the
film
like
the
whole
chosen
one
angl
luca
wa
go
for
imo
the
movi
should
have
focu
sole
on
the
propheci
concept
the
whole
idea
of
anakin
skywalk
be
space
jesu
could
be
good
if
done
right
of
cours
the
onli
thing
i
like
wa
the
action
scene
and
the
music
phil
hard
cor
e
so
coulda
done
without
the
whole
i
kidnap
and
beat
women
excus
for
a
joke
margarinebutt
oh
my
god
you
just
gave
me
a
brain
aneurysm
caleb
bubba
gafford
first
i
will
admit
that
the
stori
is
illog
in
episod
1
as
are
most
fantasi
sci
fi
plot
becaus
they
all
tend
to
ignor
common
sens
and
practic
solut
in
favor
of
theatric
and
2
and
3
seem
to
me
to
advanc
the
plot
that
were
left
hang
in
ep
1
except
the
midichlorian
issu
i
admit
that
be
said
there
were
discrep
of
logic
in
the
origin
trilog
as
well
as
far
as
what
they
should
ve
could
ve
or
would
ve
done
secondli
from
someon
who
ha
never
read
the
peripher
regard
the
prequel
trilog
i
found
qui
gon
to
be
a
passion
master
who
lead
with
hi
gut
the
opposit
of
most
jedi
and
queen
amidala
wa
young
but
intellig
and
wise
beyond
her
year
but
with
youth
come
the
obstacl
of
be
underestim
but
she
is
someon
who
would
put
her
duti
abov
all
els
at
least
in
the
begin
third
i
find
that
tell
a
stori
of
a
power
order
and
republ
be
uproot
by
villain
who
don
t
have
the
initi
advantag
the
opposit
of
the
origin
trilog
is
harder
to
do
thu
that
explain
whi
they
had
to
set
up
with
extra
charact
and
take
three
time
as
long
as
to
get
their
point
a
cross
fourth
i
enjoy
how
they
use
polit
to
move
the
stori
rather
than
a
person
journey
i
m
a
huge
game
of
throne
fan
and
lastli
the
issu
of
the
battl
scene
be
70
choreograph
combat
and
special
effect
in
order
to
push
a
movi
now
day
that
is
what
it
take
case
in
point
the
new

i
don
t

pander

still
sting
to
thi

margarinebutt
lolwut
donald

it
s
call

and
it

so
is
your
problem
with

do
you
read
romeo

juliet
and
go
off
on
a
tangent
about
how
you
don

appreci
the
whole

on

of

suicid
thatguy
nah
thi
guy
is
hardcor
so
someon
els
figur
thi
out
alex
lee
not
hate
on
jake
lloyd
but
it
just
seem
like
a
bad
idea
to
cast
a
6
year
old
becaus
it
s
so
hard
for
them
to
given
them
precis
direct
seem
a
littl
smarter
to
start
with
a
8
9
year
old
for
just
enough
control
befor
puberti
hit
them
stardog
champion
the
expand
univers
did
somewhat
save
the
prequel
trilog
with
it
s
extend
inform
on
the
stori
but
sinc
disney
decid
to
act
like
dick
and
announc
the
eu
is
no
longer
apart
of
the
6
origin
trilog
the
prequel
stori
went
from
bare
ok
to
be
shit
again
now
we
are
onc
again
stuck
with
the
incoher
storytel
that
wa
set
in
the
prequel
and
episod
7
stori
is
go
to
make
no
sens
at
all
blahdeeblah
i
m
not
sure
how
it
s
a
compliment
that
tolkien
use
magic
to
explain
much
of
hi
world
as
that
didn
t
stop
him
go
into
ludicr
detail
mind
numb
explan
that
sap
all
the
fun
out
of
the
experi
there
s
like
3
page
in
lotr
devot
to
hobbit
lineag
for
fuck
s
sake
at
the
heart
of
the
prequel
problem
is
luca
inabl
to
creat
believ
charact
with
ani
level
of
depth
tolkien
ha
much
the
same
problem
inde
he
is
even
wors
all
hi
charact
are
just
empti
vessel
for
hi
narrat
the
onli
way
you
ever
get
ani
variat
to
tolkien
s
charact
is
when
they
belong
to
differ
speci
or
are
good
rather
than
evil
the
lotr
film
are
such
good
adapt
becaus
the
pointless
tediou
element
of
the
origin
stori
were
remov
the
charact
were
given
actual
person
we
could
believ
in
care
about
tolkien
wrote
vast
epic
stori
creat
a
world
you
can
immers
yourself
in
becaus
it
is
so
detail
so
much
thought
ha
gone
into
it
luca
ha
done
much
the
same
though
what
made
either
of
their
stori
palat
boil
down
to
the
other
peopl
involv
peopl
who
inject
empathi
and
streamlin
the

into
someth
coher
entertain
veteran

here
s
the

they

i
onli
enter
into
the

to
the
degre
that
they
might
squeez
some
dollar
from
our
irrat

for
certain

these

a

you
know
what
s
wors
than
that
shitti
episod

movi
that
guy
s
voic
fnertl
i
will
admit
that
the
stori
is
illog
as
are
most
fantasi
sci
fi
plot
excus
me
for
you
to
make
a
statement
like
that
i
suspect
you
haven
t
read
too
much
scienc
fiction
and
therefor
you
take
it
as
given
that
when
you
refer
to
fantasi
sci
fi
we
understand
that
you
are
refer
to
movi
there
is
alway
the
possibl
of
a
small
inconsist
in
order
to
move
a
stori
along
we
are
talk
about
larg
inconsist
that
strain
the
limit
of
credibl
and
the
suspens
of
disbelief
one
that
break
you
out
of
the
stori
and
have
you
activ
question
the
plot
as
the
stori
is
unfold
if
you
enjoy
the
prequel
trilog
i
don
t
begrudg
you
that
howev
you
won
t
be
abl
to
convinc
me
that
the
storytel
and
respect
for
the
intellig
of
the
viewer
compar
to
the
origin
there
is
some
solid
content
in
the
prequel
but
there
is
also
evid
lazi
write
and
gener
contempt
for
the
view
audienc
a
list
of
stori
would
be
too
long
so
here
is
a
short
list
of
author
that
you
might
find
a

what
is
it
with
rick
jager
so
while
i
agre
with
most
of
thi
i
gotta
say
the
point
of
a
deflector
shield
is
to
prevent
the
ship
from
get
hit
in
the
first
place
not
absorb
damag
like
a
health
bar
most
shot
would
just
bounc
off
which
is
whi
the
ship
doesn
t
get
it
after
it
fix
lucki
power
shot
could
still
break
through
which
caus
the
damag
in
the
first
place
not
that
thi
save
ani
part
of
thi
scene
though
yeesh
sinwar

came
up
with

retard
idea
to
let
the

you

hi

wa
that

and
the
other
movi
he
mention
at
least
had
a
protagonist
thoma
hunt
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
plinkett
say
about
lightsab
duel
in
thi
review
and
all
hi
other
is
true
for
fight
scene
in

are

that

their

creativ
choreographi
can
be
fun
on
it
own
they
live
but
the
ultim
point
of
a
fight
is
to
progress
the
stori
romeo
and
juliet
play
in
the
1600
s
probabl
didn
t
have
veri
convinc
swordplay
but
obvious
that
didn
t
keep
it
from
becom
one
of
the
most
well
known
stori
in
world
literatur
even
in
pro
wrestl
a
medium
where
a
larg
part
of
the
appeal
is
in
the
aesthet
of
the
simul
violenc
there
are
storylin
and
thing
at
stake
to
justifi
whi
match
occur
sometim
those
element
are
absent
but
even
then
a
good
wrestler
will
captiv
the
audienc
with
hi
charisma
becaus
of
thi
fan
will
becom
invest
in
these
wrestler
over
time
and
will
consist
root
for
them
regardless
of
the
circumst
surround
their
match
go
back
to
film
that
just
illustr
whi
it
s
import
for
the
audienc
to
actual
like
and
or
care
about
the
peopl
fight
chien_clean
but
matrix
had
a
horribl
protagonist
the
movi
wa
great
despit
neo
keanu
so
it
wa
bad
exampl
the
other
movi
i
agre
with
thoma
hunt
just
to
add
in
regard
to
the
final
duel
in
empir
there
are
a
few
thing
plinkett
didn
t
quit
touch
on
luke
s
first
fight
with
vader
is
a
david
vs
goliath
battl
much
like
the
x
wing
take
on
the
death
star
in
the
first
movi
thi
time
it
s
differ
though
becaus
luke
fail
and
end
up
get
hi
hand
chop
off
even
though
he
lose
though
there
are
still
moment
in
the
fight
where
he
surpris
vader
with
hi
skill
and
persever
like
when
he
narrowli
escap
be
frozen
by
forc
jump
out
of
the
carbonit
chamber
it
s
moment
like
those
that
realli
reson
with
an
audienc
underdog
are
awesom
and
when
the
odd
are
realli
stack
against
them
everi
hit
they
land
can
seem
signific
just
think
of
rocki
manag
to
floor
apollo
creed
in
the
first
round
even
though
that
wa
brief
and
onli
serv
to
piss
hi
oppon
off
it
got
the
audienc
s
blood
pump
i
haven
t
seen
phantom
menac
in
mayb
ten
year
but
look
back
at
the
clip
i
saw
there
doesn
t
seem
be
that
same
kind
of
tension
and
excit
there
wa
so
much
spin
and
flail
that
none
of
their
attack
seem
veri
signific
thi
is
someth
that
plinkett
did
mention
plu
the
darth
maul
battl
wa
initi
two
on
one
which
kind
of
make
him
the
underdog
even
if
he
is
a
realli
power
sith
lord
with
a
doubl
lightsab
if
you
made
mike
tyson
fight
two
inferior
but
accomplish
contend
at
the
same
time
you
d
probabl
expect
tyson
to
lose
even
if
he
had
horsesho
in
hi
glove
jesu
suck
gay
peni
thi
is
quit
good
it
s
hard
to
find
fault
in
most
of
hi
point
i
suspect
he
might
be
a
crimin
though
thoma
hunt
i
see
what
you
re
tri
to
say
but
it
still
work
as
an
exampl
becaus
peopl
like
the
movi
itself
and
neo
is
well
known
a
lot
of
peopl
aren
t
super
crazi
about
luke
skywalk
or
at
least
mark
hamil
s
perform
but
he
s
still
one
of
the
first
charact
who
come
to
mind
when
they
hear
the
word
protagonist
moot
point
i
thought

deebeecoop
thi

thi
clear
in

veri
begin
of

with

i
wa
about

imafckingdragn

imafckingdragn
sound

unfortun
no
also
he

i
d
thought
the
answer
wa
obviou
jager
i
just
like
the
concept
of
a
deflector
shield
instead
of
shield
be
a
littl
blue
bar
of
abl
hp
so
defend
the
concept
instead
of
the
movi
i
guess
ispyrori
when
i
first
saw
the
phantom
menac
i
can
rememb
defend
the
awesom
choreographi
of

becaus
it
wa
the
onli

is
darth
maul
himself
obi
wan

just
so
sloppi
in

everi
time
they
turn
around
to
make
a

that

hmmm
dean
mcintosh
in
the
film
they
were
tri
to
commun
that
the
jedi
were
after
thousand
of
year
of
there
be
no
sith
they
were
unprepar
to
deal
with
enemi
that
might
wield
lightsabr
against

there
s
also
lightsabr
physic
revolv
around
how
the
mechan
by
which
they
work
caus
them
to
be
extrem
unstabl
in
the
hand
of
peopl
who
lack
the
forc
the
implic
be
that
darth
maul
kick
so
much
ars
that
he
can
wield
a
weapon
that
is
more
than
twice
as
complic
to
use
and
do
so
more
effect
than
two
jedi
with
simpler
weapon
ye
i
know
thi
is
all
stuff
from
encyclopedia
and
such
shite
but
that
is
part
of
my
point
luca
reli
so
much
on
thi
expand
univers
encyclopedia
stuff
that
he
say
no
longer
count
to
explain
away
what
wa
hi
job
as
the
director
to
tell
us
iron
if
a
director
had
found
a
good
way
to
explain
to
us
that
lightsabr
have
a
gyroscop
effect
and
cannot
be
wield
by
just
anybodi
whilst
at
the
same
time
explain
how
han
wa
abl
to
cut
open
a
tauntaun
with
one
in
spite
of
that
that
would
be
just
compet
filmmak
good
filmmak
if
they
do
it
well
the
scene
in
robocop
where
they
are
assembl
robocop
whilst
hi
viewpoint
see
them
it
s
titanium
lamin
with
kevlar
are
an
exampl
of
thi
kind
of
exposit
done
like
a
boss
luca
ha
never
work
with
_anyone_
good
enough
to
do
it
that
well
but
even
a
quarter
of
the
way
would
have
been
better
than
what
we
got
even
with
a
good
explan
like
that
thi
would
not
negat
the
fact
that
all
three
particip
in
the
duel
violat
the
first
rule
of
fenc
and
do
so
repeatedli
that
is
never
show
your
oppon
your
back
dean
mcintosh
when
i
wa
younger
i
had
a
similar
mindset
i
would
defend
tpm
zealous
even
though
i
had
veri
littl
basi
from
the
actual
film
to
defend
it
with
and
the
more
i
began
to
write
stori
of
my
own
write
thing
then
pick
them
apart
and
put
them
back
togeth
and
just
tri
to
assembl
someth
that
a
profession
artist
would
be
keen
to
publish
rather
than
send
back
and
tell
me
wa
crap
the
more
i
realis
i
realis
that
everyth
plinkett
say
in
thi
video
is
spot
on
given
how
long
between
return
and
phantom
luca
had
it
baffl
me
that
he
wa
in
such
a
rush
to
get
a
script
finish
it
remind
me
of
that
statement
about
videogam
a
stori
is
late
until
it
is
releas
but
it
suck
forev
simpli
delay
the
releas
by
a
year
or
two
and
give
the
script
to
someon
who
can
write
a
good
stori
would
have
save
tpm
abov
i
wrote
in
respons
to
a
comment
by
alex
lee
in
my
respons
i
write
how
one
can
simpli
expect
an
audienc
to
automat
know
someth
or
wors
yet
expect
them
to
read
up
about
it
in
a
canon
guid
that
a
scant
fifteen
year
later
you
will
tell
them
is
invalid
that
is
what
luca
essenti
did
here
no
explan
other
than
how
you
test
posit
for
jedi
is
offer
concern
the
mechan
of
the
star
war
univers
that
is
veri
veri
bad
storytel
sinc
i
use
the
exampl
of
robocop
abov
i
will
repeat
it
here
in
five
minut
flat
paul
and
ed
explain
everyth
that
the
audienc
need
to
know
in
order
to
not
onli
have
it
make
sens
but
for
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
awesom
time
one
can
have
passiv
watch
imag
tpm
by
comparison
give
us
oh
let
me
administ
thi
blood
test
hey
congratul
you
are
a
jedi
and
noth
els
even
when
the
fan
might
want
it
we
see
noth
of
how
jedi
are
train
under
optim
circumst
how
lightsabr
work
or
even
what
make
a
person
want
to
becom
a
jedi
in
fact
that
last
one
is
a
realli
sore
point
you
see
all
that
the
prequel
have
succeed
in
is
make
the
peopl
who
were
suppos
to
be
good
guy
in
the
other
three
film
look
like
asshol
that
nobodi
in
their
right
mind
would
want
to
be
in
the
prequel
jedi
are
peopl
that
i
would
cut
down
with
my
lightsabr
if
i
caught
them
anywher
near
my
nephew
or
niec
and
that
is
all
thank
to
georg
luca
exquisit
bad
storytel
in
other
plinkett
review
he
say
let
s
stop
and
think
about
thi
for
a
second
or
word
to
that
effect
at
least
onc
i
would
urg
you
to
do
the
same
dean
mcintosh
thoma
i
would
like
to
wrap
your
comment
up
in
a
bow
and
send
them
to
one
poster
just
abov
you
on
thi
page
i
just
want
to
chuck
in
my
penni
about
a
coupl
of
thing
you
write
i
think
the
same
effect
the
who
care
what
is
happen
effect
occur
in
peter
jackson
s
middl
earth
in
name
onli
film
i
wa
watch
a
lot
of
the
make
of
around
the
time
that
the
home
video
releas
were
occur
and
one
thing
i
could
not
get
past
no
matter
how
i
tri
wa
all
of
the
brag
about
how
these
big
battl
sequenc
were
50
minut
long
and
had
thousand
of
charact
involv
when
i
wa
look
over
the
finish
product
mani
thing
came
to
mind
one
he
wa
lie
when
he
said
charact
there
s
mayb
one
or
two
charact
in
each
film
that
the
audienc
is
given
enough
reason
to
care
about
and
the
rest
of
the
battl
is
basic
anonym
figur
in
a
comput
kill
each
other
in
videogam
way
second
and
thi
is
what
i
want
to
touch
on
in
term
of
the
empir
duel
the
stori
doe
not
progress
one
iota
whilst
these
protract
battl
sequenc
take
place
it
is
as
if
the
stori
stop
dead
while
good
stereotyp
guy
murder
the
shit
out
of
bad
stereotyp
guy
empir
achiev
someth
that
i
have
onli
seen
duplic
in
one
other
film
that
i
can
rememb
13
assassin
as
the
duel
and
escap
fight
progress
you
learn
new
thing
about
the
charact
you
learn
that
there
is
a
point
that
push
lando
past
will
get
him
to
turn
on
you
even
when
you
have
him
by
the
proverbi
you
learn
that
leia
realli
is
in
love
with
han
and
most
importantli
you
learn
that
luke
and
vader
are
not
just
play
fenc
like
children
at
the
start
of
that
duel
i
could
not
help
but
think
vader
must
be
think
if
i
did
not
need
thi
suit
just
to
exist
i
would
hand
thi
boy
hi
ars
in
no
time
then
as
luke
use
the
forc
to
escap
trap
vader
adjust
hi
strategi
around
the
fact
that
luke
might
not
be
complet
incompet
after
all
the
moment
when
vader
is
use
the
forc
to
throw
stuff
at
luke
batter
him
are
all
about
soften
luke
up
for
take
to
the
emperor
but
the
real
fusion
of
storytel
with
visual
excit
is
that
quick
moment
where
luke
hit
a
hit
into
vader
that
make
him
say
ouch
then
quickli
retali
by
cut
luke
s
hand
off
we
see
that
had
luke
exercis
some
patienc
and
not
given
in
to
the
vision
of
hi
friend
be
tortur
the
outcom
of
the
fight
might
have
been
veri
differ
he
learn
enough
along
the
way
to
at
least
remind
vader
that
vader
is
not
invulner
i
will
be
brief
about
jedi
that
score
music
where
we
hear
the
bariton
men
wordlessli
hum
tell
more
stori
than
anyth
go
on
in
the
other
two
segment
of
the
battl
put
togeth
it
tell
the
audienc
oh
no
everyth
the
last
few
jedi
have
been
strive
for
for
the
past
five
or
six
hour
is
gone
mayb
forev
it
is
the
star
war
equival
of
the
moment
in
robocop
where
robocop
is
angrili
stride
out
of
hi
rest
chamber
with
scienc
men
vainli
urg
him
to
stop
call
me
what
you
like
but
i
actual
enjoy
jedi
slightli
more
than
ani
other
sw
film
for
that
part
alon
but
the
point
of
all
that
is
that
it
prove
plinkett
is
right
about
the
duel
they
are
not
about
fight
but
rather
the
stori
that
lead
into
them
and
the
stori
that
lead
into
the
tpm
duel
is
crap
no
it
s
shit
i
do
howev
disagre
about
the
darth
maul
duel
up
to
a
point
there
are
underdog
and
underdog
and
again
thi
is
part
of
what
plinkett
is
talk
about
in
hi
review
about
the
stori
versu
choreographi
ye
i
know
say
the
novel
say
is
bonehead
but
hear
me
out
the
text
about
the
duel
talk
about
how
maul
is
alway
in
control
how
after
thi
amount
of
time
the
jedi
are
no
closer
to
win
and
so
forth
but
becaus
we
are
given
no
basi
on
which
to
understand
how
elit
maul
is
suppos
to
be
we
cannot
understand
thing
like
that
from
the
film
what
i
would
have
done
is
have
a
few
scene
in
the
film
where
jedi
are
be
kill
in
group
and
nobodi
know
who
is
do
it
until
maul
pop
out
of
nowher
on
tattooin
and
tri
to
take
down
qui
gon
a
quick
moment
where
five
jedi
are
come
to
the
aid
of
some
unrel
person
and
maul
kill
them
all
anyth
like
that
but
luca
is
and
wa
such
an
idiot
that
he
think
he
can
just
have
one
actor
with
no
charact
develop
whatev
do
flip
and
kick
and
swing
a
two
blade
sabr
and
audienc
will
automat
twig
that
the
jedi
are
come
from
a
place
of
weak
in
thi
battl
it
is
kind
of
like
how
they
do
it
in
the
real
x
men
film
they
make
it
pain
clear
that
the
normi
have
all
the
weapon
control
of
societi
etc
etc
so
the
onli
thing
save
the
mutant
from
doom
is
their
power
a
good
director
like
bryan
singer
or
matthew
vaughn
know
you
do
not
take
it
for
grant
that
an
audienc
know
or
understand
thing
like
that
hell
a
vagu
compet
directli
know
not
to
take
it
for
grant
so
i
submit
to
you
that
in
the
hand
of
a
good
director
the
audienc
would
have
known
that
darth
maul
is
the
forc
equival
of
bruce
lee
and
qui
gon
obi
wan
are
the
equival
of
newli
mint
black
belt
in
that
context
the
audienc
should
have
been
surpris
that
qui
gon
last
for
as
long
as
he
did
everyon
can
chew
me
out
at
their
leisur
for
say
it
but
the
thing
luca
_did
not_
explicitli
spell
out
on
the
screen
such
as
maul
s
true
abil
or
the
oper
physic
of
lightsabr
are
what
seal
him
as
an
incompet
dickhead
not
what
he
_did_
put
on
the
screen
alex
lee
thi
would
not
negat
the
fact
that
all
three
particip
in
the
duel
violat
the
first
rule
of
fenc
and
do
so
repeatedli
that
is
never
show
your
oppon
your
back
thi
is
whi
there
s
no
tension
in
the
fight
i
m
just
judg
it
base
on
what
is
present
but
mani
peopl
such
as
the
nostalgia
critic
just
think
it
s
a
kick
ass
sword
fight
when
it
realli
isn
t
andrew
thompson
am
i
the
onli
one
who
made
their
own
lightsab
but
now
want
to
shove
it
up
georg
ars
andrew
thompson
shame
you
didnt
make
that
comment
10
year
ago
when
the
charact
wa
invent
dean
mcintosh
there
is
also
a
funni
littl
detail
that
luca
invalid
with
hi
eu
is
not
canon
edict
that
say
lightsabr
cosmet
relat
to
person
histori
if
you
look
at
qui
gon
s
older
obi
wan
s
and
luke
s
rotj
lightsabr
you
notic
they
have
a
lot
in
common
the
same
is
true
of
anakin
s
vader
s
lightsabr
next
to
yoda
s
but
i
digress
i
am
probabl
the
onli
person
who
took
ani
notic
of
that
whilst
watch
tpm
or
ani
prequel
at
the
premier
the
fact
that
i
took
notic
of
it
dure
these
duel
say
a
lot
about
me
and
the
duel
heh
probabl
the
moment
that
came
off
the
worst
for
me
in
the
naboo
duel
howev
wa
when
maul
awkwardli
balanc
himself
on
the
edg
of
a
platform
block
both
of
hi
oppon
at
onc
then
backflip
onto
a
path
that
ha
got
to
be
at
least
a
long
jump
record
away
from
him
i
mean
the
other
shot
in
the
duel
i
can
sort
of
at
least
understand
as
have
some
form
of
purpos
or
progress
within
the
fight
but
that
one

orvil
ketchum
i
agre
with
most
of
what
you
wrote
here
and
think
you
did
a
good
job
in
make
your
argument
i
do
disagre
with
your
final
argument
in
a
small
way
the
reason
whi
the
duel
in
empir
work
is
becaus
we
know
that
vader
is
a
power
and
corrupt
charact
and
that
luke
is
essenti
an
up
and
comer
they
never
made
thi
statement
in
the
movi
yet
the
audienc
know
thi
without
it
be
spell
out
vader
use
the
forc
to
choke
a
command
offic
to
death
in
front
of
anoth
offic
while
he
s
promot
him
to
the
posit
of
the
man
who
s
liter
die
next
to
him
thi
wasn
t
for
laugh
thi
wa
to
drive
home
what
the
stake
are
and
who
vader
is
hi
power
and
willing
to
util
it
thi
also
inform
the
audienc
that
he
s
in
control
now
and
there
s
no
grand
moff
tarkin
to
pull
the
leash
on
him
and
we
re
remind
of
thi
when
anoth
command
lose
track
of
the
falcon
goe
to
apologist
and
is
kill
for
hi
effort
when
you
see
luke
struggl
to
maintain
control
over
the
object
he
s
levit
while
hi
mind
is
flood
with
imag
of
hi
friend
endur
a
lot
of
pain
we
know
that
he
s
not
as
power
as
vader
and
the
audienc
wonder
how
he
s
go
to
overcom
thi
challeng
in
the
phantom
menanc
in
order
for
the
fight
scene
in
the
end
to
matter
i
would
have
shown
the
jedi
s
spar
with
each
other
jin
duel
anoth
jedi
who
s
clearli
better
and
is
a
step
faster
kenobi
s
spar
with
a
fourth
jedi
and
is
dispatch
even
faster
they
don
t
even
need
to
say
anyth
cute
like
you
re
train
him
your
student
is
in
troubl
later
these
two
jedi
s
shown
in
addit
scene
as
the
plot
progress
and
is
shown
to
be
the
prefer
pair
to
send
on
mission
are
attack
and
defeat
by
darth
horn
head
you
don
t
need
to
spell
it
out
but
you
do
have
to
show
the
audienc
that
horn
head
is
profici
in
defeat
multipl
adversari
simultan
there
s
a
lot
more
detail
that
can
be
ad
here
like
show
kenobi
s
youth
and
energi
by
want
to
continu
spar
while
jin
stop
him
from
over
excret
himself
show
the
other
two
jedi
accomplish
someth
els
between
the
spar
and
their
death
to
reinforc
the
idea
that
their
victori
were
not
fluke
but
in
order
to
save
the
phantom
menac
you
pretti
much
need
to
rip
the
entir
stori
into
shred
and
start
over
as
if
it

yod

the

but
in

ordinarili
and
in

take

so
they
actual
still
had
the

and
anakin

in

there
s
even

run

watto

would
the

then
the

wouldn

have
been
abl
to

mani

then
if

anakin
wouldn

have
vision
of

then
murder
a

so
the

up

some

of

that
we
never

stop
ok
i
don
t
get
it
one
prais
for
the
rlm
review
that
i
ve
seen
on
variou
messag
board
is
how
well
edit
the
video
is
howev
these
edit
trick
are
annoy
and
embarrass
when
use
to
draw
attent
to
point
that
are
just
plain
stupid
and
wrong
here
s
an
exampl
of
it
stoklasa
screech
the
sound
to
a
stop
as
if
he
s
make
some
kind
of
clever
point
here
when
in
fact
he
s
not
serious
he
doesn
t
seem
to
understand
whi
a
blockad
would
caus
a
crisi
and
ask
what
that
crisi
is
as
if
there
s
some
kind
of
stori
that
need
to
be
told
about
it
thi
is
simpli
unbeliev
a
blockad
shut
down
trade
as
he
point
out
that
obvious
hurt
a
societi
and
at
the
veri
least
a
militari
blockad
is
a
violat
of
their
sovereignti
raynor
here
is
evad
rlm
s
main
point
is
that
we
never
actual
see
the
effect
of
the
trade
feder
s
action
on
naboo
despit
them
be
an
import
drive
element
of
the
plot
we
constantli
hear
how
padm
s
peopl
are
die
and
how
the
situat
is
so
dire
on
naboo
but
we
never
see
ani
of
thi
at
all
in
fact
we
never
see
a
singl
naboo
citizen
at
all
except
a
few
pilot
and
offici
thi
aspect
of
the
movi
could
and
should
have
been
handl
better
but
in
the
end
it
turn
into
such
a
wast
opportun
also
the
rebutt
is
fill
with
excess
nitpick
which
is
someth
raynor
accus
rlm
of
do
and
a
rather
nasti
amount
of
ad

thi
is
notabl
becaus

when

http

there
s
just
so
much
wrong
with
thi
movi
that
it
s
imposs
to
cover
all
of
it
even
in
a
70
min
review
you
can
talk
about
all
the
major
thing
but
then
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
even
seemingli
minor
issu
turn
out
to
have
major
implic
take
the
bongo
ride
through
the
planet
core
for
exampl
i
get
that
in
scienc
fantasi
like
star
war
you
have
to
suspend
your
disbelief
a
littl
but
like
plinkett
say
in
the
episod
ii
review
you
can
t
stretch
the
rule
of
realiti
too
far
or
it
becom
ridicul
first
of
all
to
get
down
far
enough
to
even
reach
the
planet
s
crust
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
bongo
would
have
to
be
abl
to
withstand
enorm
amount
of
pressur
as
would
the
peopl
insid
of
it
next
you
have
the
issu
of
not
onli
have
to
dig
a
tunnel
through
the
center
of
the
planet
in
order
to
make
thi
kind
of
travel
possibl
but
actual
then
travel
through
it
thi
onli
work
if
the
entir
planet
ha
no
molten
layer
or
a
core
that
is
extrem
hot
and
extrem
pressur
so
you
could
argu
that
naboo
is
an
entir
cool
solid
chunk
of
rock
except
for
the
fact
that
a
hot
core
is
actual
necessari
to
maintain
a
magnet
field
around
the
planet
and
support
life
consid
again
the
fact
that
it
also
make
no
sens
for
the
droid
armi
to
even
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
from
their
target
you
d
think
that
if
luca
wa
realli
dead
set
on
them
meet
the
gungan
and
take
a
secret
underwat
craft
to
get
to
the
citi
he
d
just
have
the
underwat
citi
be
off
the
coast
of
theed
or
someth
and
besid
all
that
scienc
stuff
whi
would
the
gungan
have
thi
planet
core
passag
that
lead
directli
to
theed
anyway
sinc
they
don
t
exactli
seem
to
get
along
with
the
human
on
the
planet
veri
well
whi
would
they
even
want
or
need
that
my
onli
guess
is
that
they
want
to
connect
with
anoth
gungan
settlement
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
but
we
never
see
or
hear
about
one
i
don
t
know
thi
is
a
film
for
babi
so
mayb
it
s
suppos
to
appeal
to
the
kid
in
all
of
us
who
thought
they
d
end
up
in
china
if
they
dug
a
hole
deep
enough
in
the
backyard
or
someth
http

my
guess
is
that
hand
motion
just
make
it
easier
you
d
probabl
have
to
concentr
a
lot
harder
to
move
thing
with
your
mind
without
it
even
in
the
origin
we
see
it
done
both
way
luke
is
abl
to
levit
c
3po
while
hi
hand
are
tie
but
we
also
see
yoda
use
hi
hand
when
lift
the
x
wing
out
of
the
swamp
and
vader
almost
alway
hold
out
hi
hand
when
do
a
forc
choke
also
the
littl
hand
wave
serv
as
an
easi
visual
clue
to
the
audienc
that
the
forc
is
be
use
plu
i
think
it
wa
also
a
callback
to
the
handwav
obi
wan
did
when
he
use
the
mind
trick
in
a
new
hope
http
allwritethen

com
leann
i
think
the
point
he
wa
tri
to
make
wa
not
that
the
ship
get
damag
again
after
the
shield
is
fix
but
that
no
one
even
appear
to
fire
on
them
again
the
shot
would
ve
been
deflect
true
but
ultim
the
shield
still
doe
noth
becaus
right
after
it
s
fix
they
fli
away
without
be
attack
again
which
dissolv
all
the
tension
in
the
scene
franki
furbo
you
can
t
imagin
a
reason
argument
for
him
to
be
the
protagonist
becaus
you
re
onli
imagin
the
charact
from
the
way
he
appear
in
the
final
film
in
the
origin
draft
of
tpm
most
of
qui
gon
s
action
were
transfer
to
obi
wan
obi
wa
the
onli
jedi
sent
to
deal
with
the
blockad
at
the
begin
and
the
stori
follow
him
to
naboo
gungan
citi
planet
core
thebe
tatooin
all
the
way
to
corusc
where
qui
gon
final
enter
the
pictur
from
then
on
qui
gon
s
role
is
similar
to
the
finish
film
in
almost
all
refer
to
the
prequel
trilog
pre
1995
georg
state
the
prequel
trilog
would
basic
follow
the
stori
of
obi
wan
which
it
larg
doe
and
anakin
he
even
said
thi
befor
he
decid
to
make
anakin
and
darth
vader
the
same
person
obi
wan
is
a
main
charact
in
not
onli
the
entir
saga
but
specif
the
prequel
so
it
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
sens
to
give
the
principl
action
to
obi
wan
than
a
throwaway
charact
who
exist
pure
to
die
he
should
ve
trust
hi
first
instinct
there
but
i
guess
he
want
us
to
feel
some
real
stake
when
qui
gon
die
so
he
need
more
screen
time
i
m
guess
you
grew
up
with
the
prequel
and
if
that
s
the
case
i
can
see
where
it
would
be
hard
to
imagin
a
world
where
obi
wan
s
charact
might
have
been
repres
differ
than
it
wa
in
the
prequel
trilog
if
not
i
m
surpris
you
can
t
imagin
how
it
all
could
ve
been
written
differ
rememb
there
wa
a
time
when
the
star
war
backstori
wa
a
mere
outlin
larg
undevelop
and
the
charact
could
ve
been
written
differ
gl
certainli
start
with
the
idea
of
make
obi
wan
an
establish
jedi
knight
rather
than
a
padawan
the
open
scroll
even
call
obi
wan
a
jedi
knight
so
appar
gl
forgot
to
amend
it
after
switch
the
action
to
obi
wan
despit
hi
numer
attempt
at
reinforc
the
facad
that
he
had
the
entir
stori
plan
from
the
begin
in
realiti
luca
wa
just
make
it
all
up
as
he
went
along
sure
the
way
it
turn
out
the
charact
is
subordin
to
qui
gon
and
less
suit
to
be
the
protagonist
but
it
didn
t
have
to
be
that
way
benignview
you
know
someth
els
funni
i
just
notic
when
the
jedi
were
sneak
around
theed
they
could
have
just
snuck
up
on
the
viceroy
destroy
the
few
droid
around
them
and
captur
him
essenti

entir

for
be
there
in

you
could
essenti
cut
out
the
entir
rest
of
the

have
the

free
amidala
if
you
realli
want
then
instead
of

into

instead
go
for

he
s
right
there
in
the
palac
and
he
doesn

know
you
re
come
i

what
possibl
reason
would
you
have
to
not
just
free
some
captur

for

just
get
the
