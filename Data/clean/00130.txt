i
now
altern
find
holden
to
be
walk
a
fine
line
between
witti
sarcasm
and
danger
cynic
he
is
funni
there
is
no
way
around
that
but
hi
belittl
natur
also
caus
him
to
dismiss
much
from
hi
life
that
may
not
be
perfect
but
should
be
includ
there
is
noth
that
he
in
the
end
doe
not
dismiss
as

whether
it

with
what
he
is
think
whatev
it
is
he
is

becom
useless
phoni
not
worth
deal
with
hi
humor
is
sharp
and
witti
and
i
often
laugh
out
loud
while
read
but
it
is
also
an
easi
way
for
him
to
detach
himself
from
a
world
which
he
no
longer
feel
he
belong
in
or
want
to
belong
in
i
can
rememb
find

in
hi
life
which
he
still
deem
worthi
of

hi
best
attempt
to
keep
