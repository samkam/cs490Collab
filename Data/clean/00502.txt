last
weekend
i
went
to
a
famili
barbequ
and
i
wore
a
hat
that
is
not
a
rare
occur
for
me
as
i
mention
in
my
essay
on
the
male
barbershop
experi
i
have
a
pretti
thick
head
of
hair
i
ve
never
had
a
barber
who
didn
t
make
a
sheep
shear
joke
at
some
point
in
our
relationship
and
so
hat
come
natur
to
me
it
save
me
have
to
bother
with
a
comb
or
hair
gel
or
all
those
other
tool
that
i
lack
the
vaniti
to
make
use
of
on
anyth
more
than
a
special
occas
basi
anyway
i
mention
the
famili
barbequ
and
the
hat
becaus
upon
dof
my
cap
for
one
reason
or
anoth
my
sister
exclaim
are
those
grey
hair
i
see
i
have
been
awar
for
some
time
of
a
singl
silver
thread
somewher
about
half
an
inch
behind
my
hairlin
roughli
on
the
centr
of
my
head
i
admit
as
much
but
my
sister
wa
on
her
feet
crane
over
my
crown
to
examin
place
i
can
t
see
in
my
mirror
as
i
brush
my
teeth
no
there
s
seven
of
them
there
seven
i
have
my
father
s
hair
everyon
say
so
my
father
didn
t
have
a
grey
hair
until
well
into
hi
fifti
so
that
hi
lifelong
friend
mutter
among
themselv
that
he
must
use
hair
dye
to
hide
the
ravag
of
age
he
didn
t
and
a
few
stray
shot
of
salt
are
now
work
their
way
through
hi
mane
to
prove
it
i
laugh
off
my
sister
with
the
thought
that
perhap
i
will
not
follow
my
father
s
hair
base
footstep
after
all
she
chang
the
subject
suspect
she
had
embarrass
me
actual
i
m
rather
pleas
from
my
earli
teen
until
my
earli
twenti
i
wa
easili
mistaken
for
a
fourteen
year
old
asid
from
bar
and
liquor
store
thi
ha
also
been
an
impedi
to
a
great
mani
social
interact
and
so
i
m
quit
happi
to
be
leav
that
part
of
my
life
safe
behind
me
i
have
no
fear
of
look
my
age
and
the
idea
of
have
a
few
silver
strand
at
twenti
seven
doesn
t
troubl
me
at
all
my
whole
life
i
ve
want
to
be
about
five
year
older
than

i
must
admit
the
prospect
of
actual
age
strike
me
as
someth
to
look
forward
to
it
hold
fewer
terror
for
men

up
with
someth
that
would
prove
employ
in
the
end
it
wa
a
warm
night
and
i
wait
for
him
to
confess
an
interest
in
chemistri
or
biolog
or
law
or
the
like
without
ani
hurri
or

palpabl
thing
onli
he
could
perceiv
i
gave
him
anoth
beer
and
let
him
talk
to
hi
heart
s
content
encourag
him
that
even
if
he
didn
t
take
it
academ
there
are
mani
avenu
to

music
in
a
citi
like
toronto
when
we
had
discuss
hi
ambit
to
join
a
band
or
perhap
particip
in
an
open
mike
session
at
the
rex
jazz
bar

turn
to
what
kind
of
music

listen
to
he
confess
as
if
it
wa
someth
to
be
asham
of
that
he
love
the
beatl
he
could
not
have
said
someth
more
like
to
evok
a
posit
respons
from
me
i
don
t
think
my
enjoy
of
the
beatl
is
ani
secret
they
have
appear
on
thi
blog
almost
as
often
as
my
grandfath
i
quickli
drew
him
into
a
discuss
on
the
brilliant
websit
the
beatl
complet
on
ukulel
which
i
have
mention
at
ever
increas
length
on
thi
blog
here
here
and
here
and
he
respond
with
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
we
talk
about
the
beatl
for
easili
half
an
hour
have
anoth
beer
or
two
while
we
did
so
final
he
ask
me
what
instrument
i
play
oh
i
don
t
play
an
instrument
i
confess
i
ve
alway
had
the
ambit
to
learn
piano
one
of
these
day
but
my
formal
music
train
stop
at
grade
eight
choir
the
nineteen
year
old
s
face
took
on
a
look
of
reproof
and
mild
disgust
as
if
i
wa
an
impost
who
had
somehow
appear
befor
him
in
the
guis
of
a
trust
friend
he
took
a
long
pull
on
the
beer
i
had
given
him
as
if
to
wash
a
sour
tast
of
disappoint
out
of
hi
mouth
then
you
can
t
be
a
real
beatl
fan
he
spat
at
me
i
had
been
six
or
seven
when
thi
kid
drew
hi
first
breath
and
at
seven
year
old
i
knew
the
word
to
easili
fifti
beatl
song
i
wa
rais
on
the
oldi
i
wa
in
the
fourth
grade
befor
i
even
knew
gener
x
had
music
of
it
own
i
know
beatl
lore
better
than
mani
men
twice
my
age
the
idea
that
i
am
unworthi
to
call
myself
a
beatl
fan
becaus
of
a
lack
of
formal
music
educ
is
absolut
laughabl
and
to
hear
it
from
a
bare
shave
manl
as
he
drank
my
beer
struck
me
as
more
than
a
littl
absurd
i
lean
forward
toward
him
in
my
chair
and
point
my
beer
bottl
at
hi
face
to
make
sure
i
had
hi
undivid
attent
sonni
i
said
i
ve
been
a
beatl
fan
sinc
befor
you
were
born
then
my
face
split
into
a
broad
grin
and
i
tip
my
head
back
and
laugh
and
laugh
becaus
it
wa
true
i
wa
have
thi
convers
