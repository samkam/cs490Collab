word
that

mani
peopl
and
if
it

let

let
them
continu

do
what
work
for

but
find
your
own
path
if
you
were

are
a

ask
yourself
about
the
topic
in
thi
book
they
are
so
eye
open
jesu
have

total
possibl
never

never

in

sound
familiar
mayb
the

repress
inform
like
thi
becaus
it
wa
a
threat
to
the

total
possibl
the
cathol
church
creat
the
biblic
canon
with
a
polit
agenda
to
wipe
out
pagan
actual
thi
seem
to
be
a

women
be
oppress
due
to
the
fear
of

men
in
power
lose
their
power
never
look
at
it
that
way
but
thi
seem
to
be
a
fact
too
is
it
help
in
broaden
my
perspect
of
the
fact
that
christian
is
just
a
religion
made
by
fallibl
peopl
it
sure
is
doe
it
open
my
mind
to
other

judiasm

bhuddism
and
want

take
the

make
for
a

airlin
novel
so
much
so
that
it
is
often
a

in

a

i
guess
it

fast

peppi
as

think
that

give

sensationalist
best

like

world
simultan
claim
that
it
s
just
fiction
while
introduc
the

with
claim
that
the

contain
within
is
fact
that
claim
is
ridicul
to
pluck
a
random
exampl
he
spend
some

talk
about

incorrectli
summar

he
ignor

agre
upon
even
by
the
cheerlead
of
the

that
he
is
sympathet
to
that
the
earliest

doctrin
held
that
christ
wa
pure
god
and
not
realli
man
the
veri

of
the

that
serv
as
the
linchpin
of
hi
novel
s
intellectu
base
such
as
it
is
thi
is
a
bad
novel
for
weak

anyon

rather

i
thought
i
would
just
run
down
a
few
like
and
dislik
about

and
leav
it
at
that
turn
on

when
you
throw

s
gonna
perk
me
up
better

the

like

a

the
execut
of

wa
often
frustrat

i
m
not

feel
the
need

detail
about

oh
so
clever
plot
so
that
my
economi
size
brain
could
grasp
it
for

there
would
be
a

that
i

would
exhaust
me
with
explain
exactli
what
that
meant
and
exactli
what
the

were
and
make
sure
i
knew
exactli

of
plod
for

turn
actioni

there
wa
just
too
much
sideway

of

some
realli
unnecessari

way
too
much
time
spent
slow
down
to
take
a
look
around
and
where
we
are
and
where
we
ve
been
i
start
get
the
impress
that
brown
wa
tri
to
hit
a
particular
page
count
for
the
book
and
didn
t
have
anyth
but
filler
to
loan
the
page
with
thi
is
never
a
good
thing
for
thi
kind
of
stori
3
the
end
not
a
big
fan
of
the
final
resolut
of
the
stori
and
i
found
it
veri
un
climaxi
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
onc
we
have
the
big
reveal
veri
littl
new

got
ad
to

and
i
felt
like
my
curios
should
have
been
stroke
a
few
more
time
than
it
wa
in
the
home
stretch
thi
lack
of
satisfi
climax
left
me
with
a
seriou
case
of
blue
brain
still
overal
thi
wa
a
good
servic
mysteri
thriller
that
seem
tailor
made
for
a
warm
afternoon
on
the
sand
it
isn
t
great
literatur
or
even
good
literatur
but
it
is
a
good
thriller
a
good
concept
and
for
the
most
part
fun
it
seem
to
accomplish
pretti
much
exactli
what

the

you
get

some
of

cryptologist
sophi
neveu
who
is
tout
as
brilliant
but
who
spend
most
of
the

play
second
fiddl
to

s
encycloped
knowledg
as
they
run
around
europ
in
about
a
48
hour
time
period
i
believ
be
chase
by
the
evil
cathol

the

polic
and
assort
other
baddi
thi
europ
wide
clue

ha
been
set
in

by

who
while
be

somehow
manag
to
set
up
a
ridicul
elabor
trail
to
lead
our
hero
to
the
big
secret
confus
rememb
the
movi
where
tom
hank
spend
99
of
the
time
with
a
puzzl
frown
on
hi
face
and
the
dumbest
hairstyl
i
have
ever

him
wear
imag
error
that
frown
is
reflect
on
my
face
as
i
tri
to
figur
out
how
in
the
world
thi
novel
got
to
be
so
popular
i
think
the
answer
lie
in
the
fact
that
if
you
just
give
up
on
ani
attempt
to
analyz
what
db
is
posit
don
t
worri
about
the
write
and
just
go
with
the
flow
you
get
a
page
turner
that
hurtl
you
toward
the
point
where
you
are
merci
done
with
the
book
that
s
what
that
second
star
is
for
and
there
are
ton
of
peopl
who
love
all
that
esoter
mysteri
stuff
plu
the
book
came
to
the
attent
of
a
certain
type
of
christian
who
is
veri
easi
to
bait
into
perceiv
ani
critic
of
ani
aspect
of
christian
as
a
huge
threat
and
the
result
kerfuffl
must
have
had
db
s
publicist
offer
up
heartfelt
prayer
of
thanksgiv
nope
i
m
still
puzzl
on
my
second
time
around
i
realli
paid
attent
to
the
write
and
came
to
the
conclus
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
truli
execr
piec
of
prose
that
manag
to
includ
just
about
everi
mistak
wannab
novelist
are
told
to
avoid
i
particularli
love
the
way
you
re
in
the
middl
of
an
excit
chase
around
and
then
the
action
suddenli
grind
to
a
halt
while
langdon
launch
into
yet
anoth
of
hi
explan
and
the
bit
where
db
wa
obvious
write
with
a
map
of
pari
and
a
guidebook
at
hi
elbow
so
that
you
get
turn
by
turn
street
nav
and
a
guid
tour
of
wherev
they
happen
to
be
down
to
the
exact
dimens
of
the
room
and
can
you
say
plot
illog
and
what
about
the
move
bodi
part
langdon
s
eye
follow
her
arm
to
the
structur
ahead
and
db
s
cringeworthili
bad

so
i
don

have
to
go
over
it
again
last
but
definit
not
least
there
wa
suppos
to
be
some
sexual
attract
between
langdon
and
neveu
but
ani
time
db
went
there
it
wa
as
awkward
as
watch
your
brother
come
on
to
your
bff
there
s
someth
eerili
virgin
about
langdon
which
i
swear
manag
to
commun
itself
to

never
have
i
seen
the
tom
look
less
attract
thi
is
definit
not

veri
masochist
the
narrat
ha
to

roughli

a

in

christina

had
written
an
articl
in
which
she
dismiss
attack
the
da

code
and
cite
a
recent
interview
with
the
author
mr
brown
had
been
ask
whi
he
thought
hi
book
wa
a
success
and
had
said
someth
about
how
he
believ
that
what
peopl

wa
book
with

remark
with

that
there
were
no

in
if
i
m
rememb
correctli
shakespear

well
i

i

saddam

who
deserv
death

but
i
oppos
the
iraq

on
the
ground
that
virtual
the

to
harbor
secret
weapon
of
mass
destruct
which
wa
the
ostens
reason
for
invad
hi
countri
my
feel
about
dan
brown
were
similar
so
the

point
out
that
ms

she

correct
in

that

if

i
had
even
attempt
to
read
it
onc
or
twice
dure
my
stint
at
waldenbook
but
couldn
t
realli
get
into
it
so
i
gave
up
and
decid
to
releg
it
to
the
same
place
as
titan
and
forrest
gump
work
of
popular
cultur
that
i
have
no
interest
in
and
therefor
will
not
partak
of
but
in
a
testament
to
the
power
of
the
feminin
wile
sv
convinc
me
to
read
it
and
so
at
the
suggest
of
professor
morti
borrow
a
copi
from
my
local
librari
befor
set
out
for
the
thanksgiv
holiday
thank
to
pg
and
laurion
for
their
lend
offer
though
i
did
not
take
them
up
on
it
so
what
did
i
think
of
thi
incred
popular
highli
controversi
work
that
sold
liter
million
of
copi
spawn
a
movi
and
produc
comment
from
the

in
a
word
it
s
bad
other
appropri
singl
word
might
be
aw
atroci
terribl
or
abomin
other
similar
synonym
can
be
found
here
the
da

code
is
a
combin
of
bad
write
shoddi
histori
poor
plot
and
unconvinc
charact
that
blend
togeth
to
form
a
bare
readabl
work
the
fact
that
anyon
took
thi
work
serious
in
ani
capac
is
amaz
to
me
the
charact
are
flat
bore
and
none
of
them
exceed
two
dimens
at
best
the
histori
is
so
riddl
with
hole
as
to
be
complet
unbeliev
to
the
semi
alert
observ
my
favorit
part
is
the
explan
of
how
the
church
s
desir
to
destroy
the
sacr
feminin
is
respons
for
orthodox
jew
and
devout
muslim
bar
women
from
certain
rite
and
final
the
plot
just
make
no
damn
sens
even
the
much
vaunt
puzzl
are
fairli
trite
and
usual
explain
so
quickli
that
it
s
bare
worth
think
about
the
final
puzzl
that
the
main
charact
is
face
with
is
so
mind
bogglingli
obviou
that
anyon
who
know
how
to
draw
a
mogen
david
star

can
figur
it

so
the
question
for
me
becam
thi
given
how
aw
thi
book
is
whi
the

is

so

can

afternoon
it

to

what
i
want

be
do
sit
on

drink
tea
and
read
about
self
flagel
albino
monk
and
other
fun
thing
i
ve
given
mani
book
that
are
just
as
good
as
the
da

and
even
some
that
are
wors
three

i
meant

the

is
that
on

own
merit
i
d
have
given
the

a

a
