½
so
i
think
the
main
number
one
big
ginorm
flaw
in
thi
movi
is
the
fact
they
use
too
mani
villain
and
plot
i
m
sure
we
can
all
agre
on
thi
way
back
in
1992
a
certain
young
mr
tim
burton
had
free
reign
to
creat
the
sequel
for
hi
smash
hit
batman
in
do
so
he
stuck
in
two
main
villain
alongsid
hi
own
creation
the
penguin
catwoman
and
max
shreck
thi
seem
to
start
a
massiv
trend
that
ha
continu
to
thi
day
follow
on
from
thi
initi
idea
mani
or
most
superhero
flick
seem
to
have
at
least
two
villain
as
standard
sometim
more
and
thi
is
where
thi
film
implod
first
villain
is
venom
now
thi
alien
creatur
crash
to
earth
in
or
on
meteorit
out
of
nowher
and
that
s
it
we
get
noth
more
on
it
at
all
no
idea
where
it
come
from
how
whi
what
it
intent
are
whi
it
do
what
it
do
etc
it
just
there
and
you
gotta
accept
it
whether
or
not
the
comic
give
us
thi
inform
i
don
t
know
although
i
m
sure
they
do
but
here
in
thi
film
it
a
solid
mysteri
for
anyon
who
isn
t
a
comic
fanboy
myself
includ
so
back
stori
and
the
way
thi
charact
is
play
out
in
the
film
is
new
to
me
i
have
no
idea
if
it
correct
alongsid
the
sourc
materi
all
i
know
is
how
thi
thing
look
and
it
did
seem
well
creat
to
me
the
cgi
wa
decent
and
seem
to
captur
venom
s
appear
well
although
whi
it
would
alter
spider
man
s
spider
logo
seem
daft
it
infect
hi
outfit
and
bodi
whi
would
it
alter
the
logo
second
villain
wa
the
sandman
who
i
know
wa
bump
up
from
a
minor
comic
posit
to
a
major
role
revolv
around
parker
s
uncl
now
again
whether
or
not
thi
wa
the
right
way
to
go
if
you
re
a
fanboy
i
don
t
know
as
for
the
rest
of
us
i
felt
the
stori
arc
did
work
pretti
well
and
develop
the
sandman
into
someth
other
than
just
a
common
baddi
thi
charact
now
had
a
good
solid
famili
arc
combin
with
an
emot
connect
to
parker
which
did
feel
a
littl
forc
admittedli
like
a
clear
after
thought
but
it
manag
to
hold
togeth
i
also
like
the
visual
design
for
thi
guy
he
had
a
distinctli
old
fashion
feel
about
him
like
a
crimin
from
the
40
s
the
charact
music
theme
realli
push
that
vibe
if
you
ask
me
a
veri
bogart
esqu
tune
i
like
hi
outfit
too
again
it
had
a
veri
old
fashion
look
about
it
like
someth
gene
kelli
would
wear
the
final
villain
squeez
into
the
film
wa
harri
osborn
as
the
next
green
goblin
follow
on
from
hi
father
work
now
i
had
no
problem
with
thi
charact
be
here
becaus
he
s
been
here
sinc
the
begin
and
it
felt
right
that
thi
stori
arc
should
happen
unfortun
along
with
the
other
two
villain
it
all
felt
so
convolut
and
tight
for
space
that
the
poor
old
goblin
wa
reduc
to
sporad
appear
well
they
all
were
realli
venom
especi
so
that
thing
vanish
for
half
the
flick
the
goblin
get
conveni
injur
right
at
the
start
after
a
horrend
bad
cgi
battl
in
the
sky
with
spidey
and
we
don
t
see
him
again
for
age
it
the
same
spiel
as
befor
with
thi
charact
just
replac
dafo
with
franco
same
action
sequenc
new
outfit
that
s
all
look
wors
too
so
in
that
sens
it
seem
weak
but
you
knew
he
had
to
be
there
if
anyth
they
should
of
drop
venom
as
that
realli
seem
crowbar
in
jostl
for
ani
kind
of
screen
time
the
other
problem
i
had
with
thi
film
other
than
the
multitud
of
villain
wa
the
relationship
between
parker
and
mari
jane
oh
my
ball
thi
got
annoy
first
they
re
togeth
then
they
re
not
then
they
get
back
togeth
again
then
mari
jane
slut
around
with
osborn
then
parker
again
plu
you
ve
got
gwen
staci
in
there
too
holi
ribbon
of
snot
i
got
so
fed
up
of
see
parker
and
mari
jane
fight
whine
and
cri
jesu
plu
the
fact
mari
jane
get
fire
from
her
stage
show
after
one
perform
seem
a
bit
ridicul
and
is
obvious
done
to
crank
up
the
annoy
emot
relationship
issu
then
you
ve
got
all
that
crap
where
parker
goe
to
the
dark
side
due
to
the
venom
alien
parker
as
a
dark
charact
appar
translat
to
a
lame
look
emo
hairstyl
a
bit
of
goth
eye
shadow
and
then
act
like
the
mask
in
a
nightclub
what
an
embarrass
mess
that
wa
i
must
admit
to
be
disappoint
with
the
effect
thi
time
also
is
it
me
or
do
the
effect
actual
get
wors
after
the
first
film
see
spidey
swing
from
rooftop
to
rooftop
is
still
sweet
venom
wa
cool
and
the
sandman
had
some
great
effect
in
place
but
the
action
sequenc
becam
veri
hard
to
follow
with
fast
move
terribl
look
cgi
as
i
alreadi
said
the
initi
fight
between
osborn
and
spidey
wa
aw
look
but
the
big
final
wa
just
a
shambl
of
shoddi
cgi
and
greenscreen
a
lot
of
it
look
veri
obviou
to
me
also
not
so
sure
whi
or
how
the
sandman
is
abl
to
grow
to
such
massiv
proport
or
fli
how
doe
sand
enabl
that
and
he
kinda
look
like
a
big
lump
of
poo
i
honestli
think
thi
is
the
most
over
stuf
flick
i
ve
seen
for
some
time
or
ever
it
realli
is
so
overload
and
overli
long

thi
effect
the

is

as
thi

howev
i
find
thi

extrem
entertain
ever
sinc
i
first

in
theatr
i
wa
hook
on
all
the
cheesi

that
they
chose
to
throw

i
could
watch
thi
film
over

over
again
laugh
at
the
random
cast
choic
and
act
but
my
belief
still
stand
that
if
it
is
exclud
from
the
first
two
film
then
it
would
be
a
great
film
without
it
s

it
