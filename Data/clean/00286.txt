to

of
all
the

i
ve
ever
taken
not
have
hank
pym
in
the
aveng
wa
one
of
the
bigger
thing
howev
whedon
contest
that
it
didn
t
make
sens
to
bring
in
ant
man
into
earth
s
mightiest
movi
hero
in
an
long
interview
with
empir
magazin
aveng
age
of
ultron
director
joss
whedon
explain
whi
marvel
kept
scott
lang
away
from
the
rest
of
the
marvel
gang
and
whi
the
comic
creator
of
ultron
ant
man
would
no
longer
be
the
villain
s
creator
in
the
marvel
cinemat
univers
but
toni
stark
of
all
the
heat
i
ve
ever
taken
not
have
hank
pym
wa
one
of
the
bigger
thing
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
wa
edgar
had
him
first
and
by
virtu
of
what
edgar
wa
do
there
wa
no
way
for
me
to
use
him
in
thi
i
also
thought
it
wa
a
bridg
too
far
ultron
need
to
be
the
brainchild
of
the
aveng
and
in
the
world
of
the
aveng
and
the
mcu
toni
stark
is
that
guy
banner
ha
element
of
that
guy
we
don
t
realli
think
of
him
as
be
as
irrespons
as
toni
stark
but
the
motherfuck
test
gamma
radiat
on
himself
with
realli
terribl
way
wors
than
toni
stark
result
it
didn
t
make
sens
to
introduc
a
third
scientist
a
third
sciencetician
to
do
that
it
wa
hard
for
me
becaus
i
grew
up
on
the
comic
to
dump
that
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
a
more
interest
relationship
between
toni
and
ultron
if
toni
wa
onc
like
you
know
what
would
be
a
realli
great
idea
they
re
do
what
they
alway
do
which
is
jump
in
headfirst
and
then
go
sorri
world
but
you
have
to
make
it
their
respons
without
just
make
it
their
fault
we
ll
alway
be
down
with
more
scientist
do
scienc
in
the
highli
fiction
world
of
mcu
but
it
look
like
the
decis
to
pull
ant
man
out
of
the
aveng
wa
set
in
motion
a
long
time
ago
ah
