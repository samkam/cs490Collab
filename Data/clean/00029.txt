the
littl
princ
peopl
grow
five
thousand
rose
in
one
garden
yet
what
they
re
look
for
could
be
found
in
a
singl
rose
i
wa
sat
on
the
floor
of
my
friend
s
hous
in
london
when
i
found
thi
book
lie
on
the
floor
i
flick
through
as
a
draw
of
a
small
boy
talk
to
a
fox
caught
my
attent
not

what
to
expect
from
a
book
titl
the
littl
princ
fill
with
child
like
doodl
of
planet
inhabit
by
strang
peopl
i
decid
to
have
a
quick
read
there
wa
such
a
depth
of
mean
in
the
few
paragraph
that
i
read
that
i
knew
thi
wa
a
book
i
had
to
own
the
littl
princ
written
by
antoin
de
saint
exuperi
is
one
of
my
favourit
all
time
book
partli
becaus
i
can
sit
and
read
it
in
onli
an
hour
and
half
but
mainli
becaus
of
the
unusu
contrast
of
a
child
s
tale
with
realist
observ
about
life
and
human
natur
it
may
look
like
a
fairytal
from
the
outsid
but
thi
is
definit
someth
meant
for
an
older
audienc
publish
in
1943
origin
in
french
and
titl
le
petit
princ
the
littl
princ
tell
the
timeless
tale
of
when
a
pilot
the
narrat
crash
land
hi
plane
onto
the
sahara
desert
six
year
ago
here
he
meet
the
littl
princ
a
peculiar
charact
who
ha
also
crash
onto
earth
from
an
unknown
planet
as
the
narrat
remain
desert
tri
to
fix
hi
plane
he
goe
on
to
detail
the
stori
that
the
princ
share
with
him
as
they
both
tri
to
find
their
way
back
home
it
is
through
the
charact
that
we
meet
through
the
princ
s
travel
that
the
narrat
and
ourselv
are
taught
mani
life
lesson
and
motto
as
the
littl
princ
look
at
life
through
the
eye
of
a
child
s
but
through
an
adult
s
analyt
mind
in
the
first
chapter
the
narrat
explain
hi
dislik
toward
adult
which
becom
a
key
theme
in
the
book
the
princ
believ
that
adult
see
thing
differ
more
plainli
and
bore
to
how
children
do
and
the
differ
charact
we
get
to
meet
through
hi
journey
are
all
differ
stereotyp
of
adult
the
first
man
who
the
princ
meet
is
a
king
who
onli
order
what
is
reason
and
when
the
condit
are
favour
in
other
word
he
order
intrins
object
that
are
independ
of
anyth
els
so
that
he
can
feel
an
author
on
hi
planet
howev
he
cannot
truli
have
power
over
anyth
becaus
he
is
the
onli
occup
on
hi
planet
so
hi
isol
life
ha
therefor
led
him
to
a
life
of
pretenc
to
comfort
hi
loneli
he
say
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
judg
oneself
than
to
judg
other
if
you
succeed
in
judg
yourself
rightli
then
you
are
inde
a
man
of
true
wisdom
the
second
man
is
then
a
conceit
man
who
believ
that
everybodi
admir
him
becaus
he
wa
the
handsomest
best
dress
richest
and
most
intellig
man
on
hi
planet
and
becaus
he
wa
the
onli
man
on
hi
planet
he
is
correct
the
third
is
a
tipler
who
constantli
drink
alcohol
so
i
may
forget
that
i
am
asham
asham
of
drink
and
the
fourth
is
a
businessman
who
spent
all
day
count
the
star
becaus
believ
that
he
own
them
as
he
wa
the
first
person
to
claim
so
through
each
of
these
portray
of
adult
we
see
the
differ
way
that
men
cope
with
live
on
a
planet
alon
there
is
one
posit
portray
of
an
adult
howev
the
final
man
that
the
princ
meet
spend
hi
day
light
and
blow
out
a
lantern
on
hi
planet
even
though
he
is
the
onli
occup
the
princ
goe
on
to
describ
thi
man
s
job
as
a
beauti
occup
and
sinc
it
is
beauti
it
is
truli
use
and
say
that
he
is
the
onli
one
who
doe
not
seem
ridicul
to
me
perhap
it
is
becaus
he
is
not
onli
concern
with
himself
the
narrat
then
bring
these
charact
togeth
by
say
that
all
men
have
star
but
they
are
not
the
same
thing
for
differ
peopl
for
some
who
are
travel
the
star
are
guid
for
other
they
are
no
more
than
littl
light
in
the
sky
for
other
who
are
scholar
they
are
problem
but
all
these
star
are
silent
you
you
alon
will
have
star
as
no
one
els
ha
them
howev
whilst
these
five
men
open
the
book
with
great
mean
it
is
through
the
other
charact
that
he
goe
on
to
introduc
us
to
that
hold
some
of
my
favourit
quot
one
of
these
charact
is
a
flower
who
the
princ
often
refer
back
to
throughout
hi
journey
and
it
is
through
her
that
the
book
focus
on
an
even
bigger
human
emot
love
peopl
where
you
live
grow
five
thousand
rose
in
one
garden
yet
they
don
t
find
what
they
re
look
for
and
yet
what
they
re
look
for
could
be
found
in
a
singl
rose
thi
quot
is
a
person
favourit
again
make
a
truth
observ
that
we
go
can
through
life
have
a
number
of
relationship
but
that
what
we
are
constantli
search
for
the
one
person
that
can
give
us
everyth
we
are
look
for
furthermor
it
is
the
time
you
have
wast
for
your
rose
that
make
your
rose
so
import
and
anoth
of
my
favourit
quot
said
by
the
flower
is
i
must
endur
the
presenc
of
two
or
three
caterpillar
if
i
wish
to
becom
acquaint
with
the
butterfli
both
of
these
quot
hold
a
great
optim
with
the
latter
impli
that
you
have
to
go
through
some
bad
experi
for
a
good
outcom
and
that
situat
can
look
ugli
but
can
end
with
beauti
result
and
final
one
never
ought
to
listen
to
the
flower
one
should
simpli
look
at
them
and
breath
their
fragranc
mine
perfum
all
my
planet
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
take
pleasur
in
all
her
grace
it
is
quot
like
thi
that
are
the
reason
as
to
whi
i
love
thi
book
but
my
favourit
charact
in
the
novel
is
the
fox
who
say
the
most
beauti
thing
in
the
world
cannot
be
seen
or
touch
they
are
felt
with
the
heart
now
here
is
my
secret
it
s
veri
simpli
you
can
onli
see
thing
clearli
with
your
heart
what
is
essenti
is
invis
to
the
eye
the
princ
link
thi
to
the
desert
be
beauti
becaus
somewher
hidden
is
a
well
full
of
clear
water
and
the
narrat
link
thi
to
a
hous
becom
enchant
becaus
there
may
be
hidden
treasur
again
these
quot
are
simpl
and
almost
effortless
but
they
hold
such
a
great
depth
to
them
that
it
s
hard
not
to
find
the
book
compel
everi
chapter
leav
you
reflect
in
some
way
back
to
your
own
life
and
it
is
becaus
of
thi
that
i
can
re
read
thi
book
over
and
over
