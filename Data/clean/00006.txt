write

i

not

i
hug

i
frequent

a

in

and
write
charl
dicken
name
with
heart
around
it
they
think

m
crazi
but
it
intrigu
some
of
them
just
enough
to
make
them
doubt
the
deris

of
upperclassmen
i
reluctantli
admit
that
dicken
doe
oversimplifi
the
caus
of
the
french

the

howev
in

captur
the
spirit
of
a
tumultu

and
help

sympath

on
everi
side
of
the
develop

i
also
think
that
the
charact
of
roger
cli
and
john
barsad
get
a
bit
messi
and
may
have
work
better
as
a
singl
charact
perhap
the
confus
is
a
result
of
serial
restructur
but
realli
i
read
a
tale
of

like
a

at

i
cheer

suppos
the

that

expect
ye
there
were
long
patch

i
find
the
content
fascin
the
storm
of
the
bastil
and
the
terror
horrif
both
on
the
part
of
the
nobil

problem
i
have
with
mani
classic
with
except
like
the
count
of
mont

which
i
just
could
not
put
down
is
that
the

it

the

is
absolut
stun
in

as
it

dicken
choic
about
how

how
to
bring
to

the

for

to

to

with
the

tenac
of

alway
so
much
stronger
than

clasp
her
tight
and
even
lift
her
from
the
floor
in
the
struggl
that
they
had
my
underlin
i
just
love
that
phrase
the
vigor
tenac
of

there
is
someth
even
of
paradis
lost
here
there
is
someth
on
that
grand
a
scale
in
depict
the
fight
between
good
and
evil
among
so
mani
dualiti
set
up
from
that
absolut
extraordinari
begin
paragraph
that
mani
of
us
can
quot
by
heart
and
the
titl
itself
good
and
evil
love
and
hate
life
and
death
is
what
thi
book
come
down
to
there
is
also
an
acknowledg
of
the
grey
area
between
the
polar
there
is
an
understand
that
evil
peopl
are
do
evil
act
but
that
these
are
foment
within
a
social
and
histor
context
crush
human
out
of
shape
onc
more
under
similar
hammer
and
it
will
twist
itself
into
the
same
tortur
form
sow
the
same
seed
of
rapaci
licenc
and
oppress
over
again
and
it
will
sure
yield
the

fruit
accord
to
it
kind
it
s
veri
big
themat
histor
and
yet
it
s
also
veri
for
dicken
concis
that
combin
is
extrem
potent
and
probabl
the
central
reason
i
love
it
so
much
someth
els
to
be
said
is
the
rel
absenc
of
humour

caricatur
as
is
common
in
dicken
with
the
except
of

dicken

him
to

in

he
doesn

alway

the

then
ultim
make
the
stori
what
it
is
is
thi
imag
of
the
shi
humbl
nuclear
famili
the
blond
girl
name
luci
and
the
unassum
faceless
father
the
easiest
shorthand
for

the

that
is
not

and
even
though
i

deepli
i
mistrust
it
to
whatev
marrow
up
the
marrow
of

it
make
sens
for
what

in

it

a

for
someth
not

about

a
symbol
for
someth
that
wish

not

on
peopl
and
that
doe
seem
like
a
symbol
of
good
to
me
even
if
it
trap
are
soak
in
the
suspici
where
to
me
the
darnay
manett
famili
is
code
for
abus
and
for
valu
secur
over
integr
the
apologet
wife
who
so
desper
crave
her

affect
that
she
pretend

who

i

i
don

a

famili
ha
been

just
like
i
haven
t
seen
a
real

famili
that
would
fit
me
right
but
where
the
girl
action
hero
is
a
symbol
of
hope
to
me
i
can
see
how
luci
manett
is
a
symbol
of
hope
in
revers
of
that
but
not
in
a
bad
way
she
is
a
symbol
of
what
if
peopl
were
gener
and
she
doe
not
realli
have
enough
contrast
to
be
an
interest
charact
but
she
in
herself
is
a
contrast
becaus
is
thi
book
about
her
or
is
about
madam
defarg
realli
it
is
about
neither
and
the
one
is
onli
a
contrast
to
the

madam
defarg
is
more
interest
to

but
luci
is
still

and
she
still
ha

she
is
the
innoc
that
a

in

made
me
think
about
how
our
action
reveal
what

we
worship
if
we
today
could
call

by

you

a

that

the
extent
of

of

we
have
on
thi
matter
perhap
my
take
wa
base
more
on
someth
i
felt
wa
implicit
in
your
review
rather
than
explicit
the
fact
is
the
locu
of
power
in
the
manett
darnay
famili
lie
firmli
within
the
father
s
grasp
although
he
doesn
t
abus
thi
power
from
my
marxist
perspect
i
m
not
a
marxist
per
se
but
i
find
marxist
analysi
particularli
relev
to
thi
book
thi
manett
darnay
patriarchi
wa
a
firmli
entrench
aspect
of
the
class
system
that
the
leader
of
the
french
revolut
were
tri
to
overturn
becaus
let
s
face
it
when
there
is
such
an
imbal
of
power
in
ani
relationship
in
most
case
that
power
will
be
abus
whether
on
the
scale
of
famili
or
nation
i
think
your
notion
of
the
suburban
is
realli
interest
too
becaus
ultim
from
a
marxist
perspect
the
idea
of
thi
suburban
pictur
perfect
famili
is
a
bourgeoi
patriarchi
the
primari
purpos
of
the
suburban
famili
unit
is
to
commun
and
perpetu
one
s
own
class
statu
you
can
t
afford
to
live
in
the
suburb
unless
you
have
money
the
pictur
perfect
famili
is
the
façad
all
suburbanit
must
hide
behind
so
as
to
not
endang
their
class
posit
if
your
neighbor
knew
you
were
beat
your
kid
and
wife
they
would
probabl
find
you
too
distast
to
live
next
to
your
co
worker
ha
those
pictur
of
hi
famili
so
that
peopl
will
think
he
s
a
good
guy
he
may
be
one
or
he
may
not
be
but
the
pictur
are
there
to
protect
hi
imag
so
hi
sourc
of
incom
and
bourgeoi
comfort
will
not
be
threaten
you
notic
in

of
the
past
20
year
and
further
back
depict
of
the
lower
class
do
not
gener
have
these
kind
of
pictur
perfect
pretens
mostli
becaus
poor
folk
don
t
have
to
keep
up
thi
hypocrisi
at
least
not
to
the
same
degre
becaus
they
don
t
have
as
much
to
lose
if
they
don
t
keep
it
up
one
of
my
favorit
line
from
macbeth
is
when
malcolm
say
to
i
think
donalbain
that
though
all
thing
foul
would
wear
the
brow
of
grace
yet
grace
must
still
look
so
i
think
in
the
case
of
manett
darnay
famili
dicken
want
us
to
believ
they
are
one
of
the
few
peopl
who
not
onli
wear
the
brow
of
grace
but
actual
have
it
in
their
heart
they
are
the
rare
exampl
of
benevol
patriarchi
anyway
i
m
not
sure
how
much
of
thi
make
sens
and
i
realli
apolog
if

unpleas

sinc
you

you
have
a

i
have
to

of

and
i
constantli
learn
from

for

accur

sure
one
of
hi
greatest
talent
and
should
be
alway
note
in

i
have
also
note
anoth
trait
that
i
cannot
so
easili
put
into
word
it
s
almost
as
if
hi
stori
are
soap
opera
and
i
use
thi
term
loos
becaus
it
seem
so
derogatori
but
in
the
way
that
you
never
quit
know
what
to
expect
the
stori
might
at
first
seem
straightforward
and
the
plot
simpl
but
then
when
you
least
expect
it
new
clue
are
releas
and
each
of
the
charact
becom
intertwin
in
a
way
you
least
expect
so
much
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
book
the
action
of
each
of
the
charact
carri
so
much
more
weight
i
see
thi
in
mani
of
hi
book
and
wish
i
could
come
up
with
an
adject
to
describ

if
anyon
ha
simpl

or
sentenc
from
their
own
repertoir
to
describ
thi
pleas

besid
the
obviou
charact

and

build
aptitud
dicken
rous
everi
major
emot
of
mankind
into
thi
tale
at
first
i
thought
it
wa
mostli
about
the
love
triangl
wasn
t
thi
suppos
to
be
about
the
french
revolut
but
just
when
i
wa
get
exasper
with
the
stori
line
it
explod
into
so
much
more
the
theme
of
the
human
condit
dicken
expound
upon
are
vast
from
love
to
bitter
from
reveng
to
heroism
from
sacrific
to
friendship
and
back
to
love
again
he
touch
upon
them
all
of
the
mani
theme
thi
novel
touch
i
think
my
favorit
is
that
of
imprison
there
are
the
obviou
charact
such
as
manett
and
darnay
which
are
actual
sent
to
jail
but
then
there
are
other
that
are
imprison
by
other
thing
in
their
life
lorri
seem
unnatur
tie
to
tellson
s
bank
darnay
is
tri
to
escap
hi
past
and
of
cours
carton
who
is
trap
by
hi
restless
thi
struggl
of
man
vers
natur
is
also
seen
in
echo
of
other
scene
such
as
manett
s
attempt
with
let
go
of
hi
time
in
prison
as
he
make
hi
shoe
the
memori
of
hi
time
there
still
tortur
him
and
luci
s
habit
of
sit
in
her
parlor
as
she
hear
the
echo
of
the
footstep
in
the
street
bring
a
forebod
of
what
s
yet
to
come
combin
with
the
mingl
of
her
person
battl
and
the
polit
conflict
of
the
age
thi
theme
is
a
person
one
for
me
becaus
of
event
i
ve
endur
dure
my
life
as
well
as
how
much
easier
i
can
relat
to
a
charact
becaus
of
it
i
can
t
speak
to
them
all
becaus
i
d
be
write
a
book
but
thi
stori
cover
almost
all
of
the
major
theme
in
literatur
man
struggl
against
natur
overcom
advers
death
be
part
of
the
life
cycl
and
of
cours
sacrific
are
just
some
of
them
i
also
love
learn
new
word
and
dicken
never
fail
to
disappoint
me
there
prevar
and
tergivers
were
two
of
my
favorit
the
onli
fault
that
i
could
see
with
thi
book
were
two
dicken
s
loquaci
and
hi
predilect
for
flat
femal
lead
i
ve
alreadi
discuss
my
love
of
hi
verbos
so
those
peopl
out
there
who
want
shorter
book
well
go
read
the
twilight
saga
and
as
for
hi
insipid
femal
charact
well
these
innocu
be
are
more
than
forgiven
when
take
into
consider
hi
resplend
femal
charact
that
come
along
everi
onc
in
a
while
such
as
madam
defarg
in
tale
of
two
citi
or
miss
havisham
in
great
expect
so
overal
i
truli
enjoy
read
thi
book
even
though
i
wa
impati
to
see
the
action
start
a
littl
quicker
but
hi
write
is
so
eloqu
i
soon
forgot
my
misgiv
and
got
lost
in
thi
novel
dicken
is
a
brilliant
writer
one
of
my
favorit
and
so
differ
than
anyth
i
ve
ever
read
i
like
him
better
than
austen
or
shakespear
or
ani
other
classicist
i

m
so
reliev

so

it
wa
also
the
worst
