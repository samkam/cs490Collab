down
by
richard
adam
wa
the
first
adult
novel
i
read
as
a
child
where
the
main
charact
wasn
t
a
human
when
much
younger
i
d
enjoy
children

as

but
watership
down
wa
my
first
adventur
of
real
length
involv
anim
my
copi
of
it
much
like
the
photo
to
the
left
wa
a
use
paperback
yellow
with
age
and
bear
some
water
damag
in
the
bottom
right
corner
the
spine
wa
partial
broken
but
i
didn
t
care
the
book
cost
me
a
quarter
at
my
neighborhood
half
price
book
i
ve
alway
love
anim
for
a
time
i
d
play
with
the
idea
of
be
a
veterinarian
and
a
writer
in
middl
school
my
father
bought
me
a
microscop
kit
that
came
complet
with
slide
blade
to
take
cross
section
of
thing
petri
dish
etc
he
told
me
that
if
i
want
to
be
a
vet
i
need
to
understand
how
anim
work
i
wa
the
child
who
brought
home
babi
bird
that
had
fallen
out
of
the
nest
or
critter
with
broken
wing
limb
be
broke
meant
that
the
vet
wa
for
rich
folk
so
i
tri
to
nurs
them
back
to
health
when
i
inevit
fail
and
the
anim
die
i
cri
for
week
i
mourn
the
loss
of
life
as
if
they
were
famili
imagin
my
pain
when
i
realiz
that
cut
up
a
slug
to
view
it
under
a
microscop
meant
the
creatur
die
somehow
i
thought
that
like
an
iguana
s
tail
or
some
worm
the
slug
would
just
split
in
two
and
keep
live
to
cheer
me
up
my
father
demonstr
what
happen
when
one
pour
salt
on
a
slug
he
never
did
understand
my
sensit
toward
anim
though
in
hi
defens
he
thought
more
experi
would
eas
the
pain
sever
week
later
a
good
friend
lost
her
dog
to
cancer
my
hamster
escap
and
starv
to
death
in
my
bedroom
we
found
him
week
later
i
couldn
t
be
a
vet
not
if
it
meant
be
so
powerless
to
stop
the
suffer
of
other
i
love
read
watership
down
until
i
reach
the
end
when
i
realiz
what
el
ahrairah
wa
a
symbol
for
i
mourn
the
loss
of
my
pet
all
over
again
it
wa
certainli

first
time
i
d
been
expos
to
death
in
a
children
s
book
cough

charlott

web
but
it
meant
that
the
grand
new
world
of
sci
fi
and
fantasi
i
d
found
held
similar
topic
it
meant
that
real
life
wa
intrud
on
my
escap
it
wa
a
harsh
lesson
to
learn
but
