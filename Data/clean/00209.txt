you
mr

for
an
american

i
said
histor
stuff
i
wa
over
at
st
margaret
s
at
cley
yesterday
a
beauti
church
he
sat
down
in
the
nearest

forgiv
me
i
tire
rather
easili
these
day
there
s
a

he
show
that
he
could
smile
but
that
s
a
famou
inscript
in
these
part
accord
to
my
research
when
greev
wa
captain
of
the
orang
tree
he
had
a
mate
call
charl
gascoign
who
later
becam
a
captain
in

he
die
of
an

and
it
seem
greev
had
him
brought
up
to

to
be
buri
i
see
he
said
polit
but
without
ani
particular
interest
in
fact
there
wa
almost
a
hint
of
impati
in
hi
voic
there
s
no
trace
of
him
in
cley
churchyard
i
said
or
in
the
parish
record
and
i
ve
tri
the
church
at
wiveton
glandford
and
blakeney
with
the
same
result
and
you
think
he
might
be
here
i
wa
go
through
my
note
again
and
rememb
that
he
d
been
rais
a
cathol
as
a
boy
and
it
occur
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
buri
in
the
faith
i
m
stay
at
the
blakeney
hotel
and
i
wa
talk
to
one
of
the
barmen
there
who
told
me
there
wa
a
cathol
church
here
at
studley
constabl
it
s
certainli
an
out
of
the
way
littl
place
took
me
a
good
hour
to
find
it
all
to
no
purpos
i
m
afraid
he
push
himself
up
i
ve
been
here
at
st
mari
s
for
twenti
eight
year
now
and
i
can
assur
you
i
ve
never
come
across
ani
mention
of
thi
charl
gascoign
it
had
been
veri
much
my
last
chanc
and
i
suppos
i
allow
my
disappoint
to
show
but
in
ani
case
i
persist
can
you
be
absolut
sure
what
about
church
record
for
the
period
there
might
be
an
entri
in
the
burial
regist
the
local
histori
of
thi
area
happen
to
be
a
person
interest
of
mine
he
said
with
a
certain
acid
there
is
not
a
document
connect
with
thi
church
with
which
i
am
not
complet
familiar
and
i
can
assur
you
that
nowher
is
there
ani
mention
of
a
charl
gascoign
and
now
if
you
ll
excus
me
my
lunch
will
be
readi
as
he
move
forward
the
blackthorn
slip
and
he
stumbl
and
almost
fell
i
grab
hi
elbow
and
manag
to
stand
on
hi
left
foot
he
didn
t
even
winc
i
said
i
m
sorri
that
wa
damn
clumsi
of
me
he
smile
for
the
second
time
noth
to
hurt
as
it
happen
he
rap
at
the
foot
with
the
blackthorn
a
confound
nuisanc
but
as
they
say
i
ve
learn
to
live
with
it
it
wa
the
kind
of
remark
which
requir
no
comment
and
he
obvious
wasn
t
seek
one
we
went
down
the
aisl
togeth
slowli
becaus
of
hi
foot
and
i
said
a
remark
beauti
church
ye
we
re
rather
proud
of
it
he
open
the
door
for
me
i
m
sorri
i
couldn
t
be
of
more
help
that
s
all
right
i
said
do
you
mind
if
i
have
a
look
around
the
churchyard
while
i
m
here
a
hard
man
to
convinc
i
see
but
there
wa
no
malic
in
the
way
he
said
it
whi
not
we
have
some
veri
interest
stone
i
d
particularli
recommend
you
to
the
section
at
the
west
end
earli
eighteenth
centuri
and
obvious
done
by
the
same
local
mason
who
did
similar
work
at
cley
thi
time
he
wa
the
one
who
held
out
hi
hand
as
i
took
it
he
said
you
know
i
thought
your
name
wa
familiar
didn
t
you
write
a
book
on
the
ulster
troubl
last
year
that
s
right
i

a
nasti
busi
war
alway
is
mr
higgin
hi
face
wa
bleak
man
at
hi
most
cruel
good
day
to
you
he
close
the
door
and
i
move
into
the
porch
a
strang
encount
i
lit
a
cigarett
and
step
into
the
rain
the
sexton
had
move
on
and
for
the
moment
i
had
the
churchyard
to
myself
except
for
the
rook
of
cours
the
rook
from
leningrad
i
wonder
about
that
again
then
push
the
thought
resolut
from
my
mind
there
wa
work
to
be
done
not
that
i
had
ani
great
hope
after
talk
to
father
verek
of
find
charl
gascoign
s
tomb
but
the
truth
wa
there
just
wasn
t
anywher
els
to
look
i
work
my
way
through
method
start
at
the
west
end
notic
in
my
progress
the
headston
he
d
mention
they
were
certainli
curiou
sculptur
and
etch
with
vivid
and
rather
crude
ornament
of
bone
skull
wing
hourglass
and
archangel
interest
but
entir
the
wrong
period
for
gascoign
it
took
me
an
hour
and
twenti
minut
to
cover
the
entir
area
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
knew
i
wa
beaten
for
one
thing
unlik
most
countri
churchyard
these
day
thi
one
wa

so
no

i
wa
stand
by
the
newli
dug
grave
when
i
final
admit
defeat
the
old
sexton
had
cover
it
with
a
tarpaulin
against
the
rain
and
one
end
had
fallen
in
i
crouch
down
to
pull
it
back
into
posit
and
as
i
start
to
rise
notic
a
strang
thing
a
yard
or
two
away
close
in
to
the
wall
of
the
church
at
the
base
of
the

there
wa
a

set
in

and
i
wa
fill
with
a
sudden
irrat

that
i
stood
on

threshold
of
someth
i
knelt
over

and
tri
to

have
you
the

slope
of
the
mound
and
all
wa
reveal
i
suppos
it
wa
one
of
the
most
astonish
moment
of
my
life
it
wa
a
simpl
stone
with
a
german
cross
at
the
head
what
most
peopl
would
describ
as
an
