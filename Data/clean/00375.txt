began

back

the
onli
way
the

that

as

thi
is
imposs
still
the
onli
thing
he
know
in
the
mysteri
is
that
he
ha
anterograd

make
for
an
extrem
contradict
at
the
core
of
the

it
s
hardli
notic
amidst

great

timelin
thi
is
someth
nolan
know
and
doe
well
it
s
frustrat
but
it
can
also
be
frighteningli
entertain
and
by
that
i
mean
nolan
is
an
entertain
befor
a
realist
which
is
all
right
becaus
for
the
most
part
we
aren
t
expect
realism
when
we
go
into
the
theatr
it
is
problemat
with
a
superhero
film
becaus
we
suspend
disbelief
on
so
mani
front
remind
the
premis
of
the
film
is
about
a
billionair
playboy
who
dress
as
a
bat
to
fight
crime
that
we
can
get
exasper
when
familiar
rule
and
logic
are
not
follow
through
for
the
most

though

rack
up

acclaim

unlik
anyon
els
whi
is
that
with

prove
hi
abil
to
provid
a

that
excit
both

on

incorpor

the

these
stand

might
have
been
loos
base
on

he
drop

at
the
begin
to
the
cia
that
s
a
plausibl

s
the

i
just
want
to
suppli
a
good
amount
of
exampl
to
jog
your
memori
better

hole
would
be
the
fact
that
they
pump
