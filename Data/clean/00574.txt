frequent
linger
near
the
top
of
list
of
the
greatest
rock
song
of
all
time
given
it
place
in
cultur
iv
can
seem
like
an
album
of
moment
more
than
song
individu

have
been

and
drop
into

and
into

that
are
instantli

figur
in

mandolin
in

california
bonham
s

bash
on

roll
it
s
hard
to
hear
when
the
leve
break
by
now
and
not
think
of
hip
hop
if
led
zeppelin
s
music
form
the
dna
of
anyth
that
could
remot
be
call
hard
rock
iv
is
a
petri
dish
overflow
with
stem
cell
the
debut
wa
darker
and
moodier
ii
wa
heavier
and
iii
wa
prettier
but
the
fourth
album
is
a
triumph
of
form
meet
function
stairway
to
heaven
is
so
ubiquit
that
it
cycl
through
phase
of
deep
rever
and
self
parodi
and
the
movement
between
these
two
pole
is
so
rapid
it
all
becom
a
blur
thi
happen
both
for
individu
listen
i
m
go
to
guess
the
veri
young
still
discov
thi
song
and
have
their
idea
of
what
a
rock
song
can
be
expand
consider
and
on
the
level
of
mass
cultur
it
s
both
a
marker
of
religion
and
an
instant
punchlin
a
singular
that
suck
in
a
world
of
experi
and
observ
and
jeer
laughter
and
sincer
tear
and
compact
it
all
into
an
infinit
dens
point
like
mani
who
both
love
it
and
hate
it
i
pretti
much
never
need
to
hear
it
again
but
stairway
asid
iv
is
their
least
weird
album
it
s
basic
their
stab
at
perfect
and
they
get
there
but
thi
band
wa
alway
at
it
most
interest
at
the
margin
when
they
had
the
possibl
of
failur
by
1973
zeppelin
s
onli
competit
for
biggest
band
in
the
world
wa
the
stone
who
were
lose
their
hunger
later
that
year
the
stone
would
put
out
goat
s
head
soup
begin
a
period
of
drift
they
wouldn
t
return
from
until
1978
s
some
girl
the
field
wa
clear
with
the
60
start
to
reced
in

still
a
coupl
of

zeppelin
didn
t
wast
the
opportun
hous
of
the
holi
their
fifth
album
in
four
year
take
the
most
power
moment
of
the
fourth

and
amplifi
them
and
also
add
some
oddbal
experi
that
flesh
out
the
led
zeppelin
stori
they
are
most
in
the
zone
on
over
the
hill
and
far
away
which
is
on
a
veri
short
list
of
best
song
zep
ever
wrote

is
to

it

asid
from

all

creat
while
the

wa
be

and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
but
the
truth
is
page
could
just
as
easili
make
an
altern
mix
of
ani
one
of
these
song
thi
morn
and
no
one
would
know
the
differ
the
fact
that
a
mandolin
wa
briefli
consid
to
be
slightli
louder
for
a

sound
is
basic
a
stray
fact
and
noth
more
all
it
provid
is
a
chanc
to
hear
familiar
perform
in
familiar
song
in
a
way
that
sound
slightli
unfamiliar
among
the
first
six
record
asid
from
iii
physic

suffer
least
from
overfamiliar
it
s
led
zeppelin
s
white
album
the
one
they
made
when
they
were
at
their
creativ
peak
and
had
a
million
idea
but
were
also
under
a
tremend
amount
of
strain
and
saw
the
end
start
to
come
into
focu
it
s
also
to
my
ear
their
best
album
even
if
it
s
not
as
unifi
or
complet
as
some
of
what
had
come
befor
whi
their
best
first
of
all
there
s
more
of
it
the
previou
two
album
were
awesom
but
each
had
just
eight
song
physic
graffiti
ha
15
it
s
math
when
you
are
talk
about
song
from
thi
period
of
the
band
that
make
it
roughli
twice
as
good
but
physic
graffiti
is
zeppelin
s
best
album
ultim
becaus
it
felt
like
a
culmin
in
some
sens
it
wa
liter
so
sinc
it
track
had
been
record
over
the
cours
of
the
previou
few
year
and
in
some
case
were
leftov
from
the
previou
few
record
the
best
of
the
new
materi
wa
still
too
much
for
a
singl
record
so
they
went
back
to
unreleas
song
and
decid
to
flesh
out
a
full
2xlp
the
song
are
all
over
the
place
but
the
band
make
it
all
work
togeth
icon
riff
abound
custard

the
wanton
song
and
hous
of
the
holi
alon
have
more
hook
than
most
rock
band
manag
in
a
career
but
here
they
are
just
the
begin
of
the
