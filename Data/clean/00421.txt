if
you
can
train
a
bloodhound
or
a
killer
whale
whi
couldn
t
you
train
a
raptor
i
don
t
think
thi
is
a
bad
idea
at
all
plot
wise
in
fact
it
sound
like
the
normal
thing
a
zoo
would
do
i
live
right
next
to
the
san
diego
safari
zone
and
two
of
the
most
popular
exhibit
are
show
involv
the
most
unwieldli
anim
the
eleph
show
and
the
cheetah
feed
time
show
the
cheetah
show
is
particularli
gnarli
now
that
such
a
thing
could
be
a
bad
idea
if
the
jp
world
were
real
is
up
for
debat
think
blackfish
but
the
fact
is
zoo
and
marin
park
are
go
to
tri
train
their
anim
it
s
just
what
they
do
so
from
a
stori
standpoint
it
make
sens
that
a
dino
handler
might
have
train
raptor
and
don
t
think
for
one
second
that
previou
incid
involv
killer
whale
aggress
or
aggro
eleph
have
curb
the
opinion
of
zoo
runner
one
