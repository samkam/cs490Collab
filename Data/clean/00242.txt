and
even
hi

appear
we
ve
compil
some
of
the
more

after
the

everyon
is
probabl
most
curiou
about
the

they

becaus
we

that
span
all
three

and
we
should
be
finish
with
all
three

centuri

2016
2017
and
2018
releas
date
for

so
it
final
look
like
the
avatar
sequel
are
come
to
fruition
cameron
wa
also
ask
whi
he
decid
to
make
more
avatar
sequel
instead
of
move
onto
someth
els
like
the
long
promis
battl
angel
and
he
repli
by
say
he
wa
mostli
motiv
by
how
audienc
respond
to
the
eco
friendli
messag
of
the
film
my
intent
when
i
made
avatar
wa
to
do
battl
angel
next
howev
the
posit
feedback
for
avatar
and
the
support
of
the
messag
of
avatar
encourag
me
to
do
more
of
those
film
for
me
the
success
wa
a
factor
becaus
i
wa
encourag
by
the
fact
that
an
environment
film
or
a
film
about
natur
could
be
success
it
s
certainli
not
just
about
money
i
m
consid
success
to
mean
the
measur
of
the
abil
of
the
film
to
commun
everi
director
want
their
film
to
commun
the
biggest
factor
howev
is
the
drive
to
continu
develop
the
world
more
charact
more
creatur
with
unfett
creativ
the
filmmak
also
look
back
on
the
make
of
avatar
reveal
that
it
wa
the
edit
process
and
not
the
product
that
wa
the
most
difficult
to
navig
when
we
were
make
avatar
when
we
start
it
we
natur
assum
it
would
be
somewhat
success
becaus
it
had
the
element
peopl
like
you
know
fantast
environ
and
good
charact
and
a
love
stori
but
then
as
we
got
deeper
into
the
product
and
it
becam
one
of
the
highest
cost
film
of
all
time
there
wa
genuin
concern
that
it
would
never
break
even
that
it
would
never
make
money
and
we
had
a
veri
difficult
post
product
becaus
the
film
wa
too
long
and
i
wound
up
edit
the
film
for
over
a
year
and
we
took
out
about
45
minut
of
film
and
i
think
at
the
moment
we
releas
the
film
we
still
believ
it
wa
too
long
onc
it
came
out
it
wa
clear
the
film
for
most
viewer
wa
too
short
they
want
more
of
that
world
have
helm
the
excel
alien
cameron
wa
ask
about
hi
thought
on
the
prequel
prometheu
unsurprisingli
he
wasn
t
hesit
to
reveal
hi
issu
with
the
pic
interest
i
thought
it
wa
an
interest
film
i
thought
it
wa
thought
provok
and
beauti
visual
mount
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
didn
t
add
up
logic
but
i
enjoy
it
and
i
m
glad
it
wa
made
i
like
it
better
than
the
previou
two
alien
sequel
the
filmmak
confirm
that
he
did
inde
discuss
collabor
with
ridley
scott
on
a
propos
alien
5
but
it
demateri
after
fox
move
forward
with
alien
vs
predat
fox
and
i
never
talk
about
alien
3
i
don
t
rememb
the
time
exactli
but
i
might
have
been
make
the
abyss
at
that
time
also
for
fox
what
came
up
wa
the
idea
of
do
alien
5
and
at
one
point
i
pitch
that
i
would
write
it
and
produc
it
and
ridley
would
direct
it
and
we
had
lunch
talk
about
thi
and
we
were
in
violent
agreement
then
noth
happen
what
happen
wa
fox
went
ahead
with
alien
vs
predat
and
i
said
i
realli
don
t
recommend
that
you
ll
ruin
the
franchis
it
s
like
univers
do
dracula
versu
the
werewolf
and
then
i
lost
interest
in
do
an
alien
film
but
prometheu
is
seen
as
the
a
level
alien
as
oppos
to
rather
the
deriv
i
don
t
think
i
have
anyth
to
offer
on
the
prometheu
sequel
that
s
ridley
s
i
think
i
ll
stick
to
the
avatar
univers
though
cameron
enter
a
fulli
realiz
alien
univers
to
helm
alien
the
termin
franchis
wa
hi
babi
with
thor
the
dark
world
director
alan
taylor
gear
up
to
begin
product
on
the
new
reboot
termin
genesi
cameron
wa
ask
about
hi
thought
on
the
new
film
and
the
franchis
as
a
whole
well
i
have
to
be
object
or
as
object
as
possibl
about
that
i
m
not
big
fan
of
the
film
i
think
that
the
big
idea
of
the
first
movi
i
didn
t
make
the
second
film
until
i
had
an
idea
as
big
as
the
first
film
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
moral
complex
of
the
stori
and
ask
the
audienc
by
the
end
of
the
film
to
cri
for
a
termin
i
don
t
think
that
the
3rd
or
4th
film
live
up
to
that
potenti
sarah
connor
chronicl
i
never
realli
watch
much
of
it
so
i
never
gave
it
a
chanc
i
get
to
get
hook
like
you
have
to
with
a
tv
seri
i
m
hope
that
the
new
film
which
are
be
made
right
now
as
a
reboot
but
still
involv
arnold
schwarzenegg
will
be
good
from
what
i
ve
seen
from
afar
it
look
like
they
will
be
quit
good
cameron
also
offer
hi
thought
on
recent
film
expectedli
peg
graviti
as
hi
favorit
pic
of
2013
but
also
singl
out
captain
america
the
winter
soldier
as
a
recent
film
he
enjoy
thi
year
2014
i
haven
t
seen
that
much
that
inspir
me
yet
my
favorit
film
of
last
year
hand
down
wa
graviti
and
i
wa
hope
it
would
win
best
pictur
but
certainli
happi
that
my
friend
alfonso
cuaron
won
best
director
i
did
think
that
thi
new
captain
america
wa
an
interest
film
for
it
genr
in
that
it
tackl
thi
idea
of
digit
surveil
and
the
kind
of
dark
side
of
our
hyperconnect
societi
cameron
is
certainli
in
tune
with
recent
advanc
in
technolog
and
he
offer
hi
thought
on
the
futur
of
the
movi
and
what
he
d
like
to
see
done
differ
in
the
present
of
film
48
fp
to
me
is
not
a
format
it
s
a
tool
like
music
it
s
good
to
use
sparingli
and
in
the
right
spot
i
believ
all
movi
should
be
made
in
3d
forev
but
the
project
need
to
be
better
and
brighter
i
want
peopl
to
see
in
the
movi
theater
what
i
am
see
in
my
perfectli
calibr
screen
room
and
peopl
aren
t
see
that
larger
format
i
d
love
to
see
screen
get
bigger
in
term
of
storytel
i
d
like
to
see
hollywood
embrac
the
calib
of
write
in
featur
film
that
we
re
current
see
in
the
seri
on
televis
more
emphasi
on
charact
and
less
on
explos
and
pyrotechn
and
i
m
talk
the

i
think
they
re
obnoxi
loud
and
fast
not
that
i
don
t
like
loud
fast
scene
i
just
don
t
like
whole

that
are

someon
mention
the
whole
float

debacl
from

and
cameron
still
defend
poor

did
an

and
prove
that
two
peopl
could
have
float

the

in
such
a
way
that
both
could
have
surviv
but
it
involv
use
both
of
their
floatat
vest
rig
under
the
door
in
such
a
way
that
they
wouldn
t
detach
what
they
neglect
to
incorpor
wa
the
amount
of
time
that
they
would
have
had
to
spend
submerg

the
vitriol
slung
at
thi

how
can
a

not

weird
eh
i

and
a
lack

as
you

is
beyond

he

not
obviou

on
hi
way
i
think
i
help
him
skip
a
rung
or

on

ladder
mayb
but
he
certainli
would
have
gotten
there
on
hi

be
less
of
a
hypocrit
spend
those

dollar
on

work
instead

he
doe
at

no

care
about
hi
thought
on

or
that
hi
fan
are
the
minor
is
silli
he
is
go
to
go
down
in
histori
as
one
of
the
all
time
great
sci
fi
writer
director
and
the
major
of
peopl
would
agre
that
he
should
and
even
if
all
he
doe
is
shovel
box
offic
bait
critic
recept
and
box
offic
receipt
make
it
clear
he
doe
it
twice
as

norrtron
well
appar
the

care
about
hi
opinion
of
prometheu
sinc
he
wa
the
one
who
ask
him
melw
it
wa
a
reddit
ama
norrtron
the
point
remain
the
same
melw
i
know
i
didn
t
intend
to
argu
bigjimslad
disown
alien
that
ha
to
be
the
most
rewatch

other
than
the

i
ve
cherish

everi
time
i
watch
it
smart
ninja
the
alien
script
wa
aw
oh
dear

disown
alien
whi
would
you
disown
a
film
whose
art
design
and
characteris
along
with
ridley
scott
s
blade
runner
is
in
the
fabric
of
most
sci
fi
film
video
game
and
comic
book
to
date
i
care
about
hi
opinion
becaus
he
s
one
of
the
true
icon
of
the
genr
next
you
ll
be
say
you
don

come

but
on

of
that
he
ha
been
write
3
other
screenplay
becaus
they
are
all
be
shot
at
the
same
time
and
so
what
if
he
is
take
hi
time
i
rather
have
him
take
as
much
time
as
he
need
rather
than
just
churn
out
crap
just
for
the
sake
of

if

i
just
think
for

who

from

movi
he
shouldn

be
so
quick
to
dismiss
a

it
my
absolut
favorit
book
to
read
are
just
silli
and
escapist
i
prefer
genr
fiction
to
literatur
so
when
i
read
an
x
men
novel
that
is
campi
and
ha
no
attempt
at
deeper
mean
i
acknowledg
that
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
that
isn
t
me
depric
the
novel
rememb
that
i
love
it
the
point
is
that
while
i
valu
it
for
what
it
is
i
also
recogn
what
it
is
not
so
if
you
re
talk
about
a
list
of
your
favorit
book
and
you
say
that
you
love
huckleberri
finn

s

the
rare
novel
that
manag
to
transcend
what
it
is
gulliv
s
travel
and
x
men
vs
aveng
it
make
sens
to
acknowledg
that
the
last
in
that
list
is
simpli
good
for
what
it
is
the
book
equival
of
a
tent
pole
action
movi
that
isn
t
dismiss
in
my
mind
or
even
declar
it
as
a
lesser
form
of
art
it
is
tip
your
hat
to
the
fact
that
someon
that
valu
the
idea
in
those
other
book
might
not
enjoy
it
in
the
same
context
i
actual
find
it
interest
becaus
if
cameron
is
go
to
be
complet
honest
with
himself
avatar
wa
pretti
terribl
as
a
thought
examin
of
human
motiv
and
how
we
perceiv
the
other
but
it
wa
great
as
a
simpl
scifi
fantasi
adventur
with
alien
landscap
and
big
explos
it
wa
good
for
what
it
wa

diazfan209
i
would
have
ask
him
whi
true
lie
and
the
abyss
aren
t
on
blu
ray
aprilshouldberedhead
i
love
jame
cameron
and
the
nay
sayer
are
just
angri
at
hi
outstand
success
becuz
who
ha
a
movi
like
titan
then
top
it
after
a
12
year
break
so
i
think
he
get
some
reseant
but
otherwis
he
is
veri
intellig
and
deserv
more
respect
alan
parker
i
love
and
repeatedli
watch
most
jame
cameron
movi
but
i
honestli
think
that
avatar
is
one
of
hi
worst
movi
which
onli
miss
out
on
be
worst
becaus
of
true
lie
becaus
yeah
the
avatar
sfx
are
amaz
but
when
i
look
past
that
i
onli
see
a
fairli
good
movi
and
i
onli
watch
it
onc
on
dvd
and
anoth
time
on
tv
but
i
realli
don
t
feel
the
urg
to
watch
it
again
unlik
mani
of
hi
other
movi
which
i
can
t
even
count
how
mani
time
i
ve
watch
disqus_atlq8zmtsd
alan
i
would
strongli
encourag
you
to
see
avatar
in
the
best
3d
format
avail
in
your
market
when
they
inevit
offer
marathon
screen
prior
to
avatar
2
have
watch
the
movi
in
imax
and
at
home
i
can
honestli
say
that
everi
last
one
of
the
critic
of
avatar
is
perfectli
valid
but
not
a
singl
one
of
those
critic
detract
from
what
an
incred
view
experi
it
is
it
pull
you
into
the
world
and
make
you
feel
as
if
you
are
there
or
at
least
it
make
you
long
to
actual
be
there
the
3d
is
a
phenomen
tool
and
realli
doe
make
the
movi
rather
than
be
the
gimmick
it
is
in
mani

3d
in

made
the
movi
for
me
i
felt
fulli
immers
in
a
wonder
imagin
and
detail
world
i
love
it
and
not
for
some
explos
come
out
of
the
screen
at
me
or
someth
the
vista
were
incred
i
agre
with
cameron
that
eventu
it
would
be
nice
if
all
movi
were
film
in
3d
with
market
satur
it
would
quit
be
gimmicki
and
simpli
be
part
of
the
present
do
charact
drama
need
it
no
but
there
is
no
reason
that
the
scene
would
somehow
be
less
dramat
in
a
3d
format
and
might
actual
be
slightli
more
immers
i
like
the
tool
even
if
the
peopl
use
it
haven
t
figur
it
out
yet
underground
anthem
tx
it
s
so
funni
that
you
say
that
nomi
when
i
wa
younger
i
realli
didn
t
appreci
the
first
termin
as
a
kid
i
thought
it
look
cheap
about
15
year
ago
it
final
grab
me
and
didn
t
let
go
i
just
watch
it
a
few
month
ago
and
you
re
right
what
a
classic
i
still
think
t2
is
probabl
superior
but
the
termin
is
a
great
flick
underground
anthem
tx
josh
and
destroy
i
took
that
statement
to
mean
all
tentpol
popcorn
movi
should
be
in
3d
but
mayb
he
wa
mean
all
movi
in
that
case
i
d
disagre
as
well
the
master
would
not
have
been
better
if
it
wa
made
in
3d
80srobot
i
thought
the
3d
work
well
in
gatsbi
in
the
first
half
of
the
movi
when
it
take
you
into
the
mansion
new
york
citi
and
gatsbi
s
parti
but
throughout
the
second
half
it
wasn
t
as
visual
dazzl
anymor
perhap
becaus
the
gimmick
wore
itself
out
or
there
just
wasn
t
anyth
left
in
that
world
to
showcas
in
3d
djangobro
as
a
kid
i
absolut
couldn
t
stop
watch
t2
i
fuck
love
that
movi
so
much
it
s
what
got
be
into
cameron
s
film
t1
is
great
i
m
just
so
use
to
t2
that
i
love
it
more
underground
anthem
tx
exactli
django
and
what
s
so
awesom
about
t2
is
that
you
realli
don
t
even
need
to
see
the
first
termin
to
get
it
when
i
saw
t2
in
