age
of

the
writer
and
director
had
a
pretti
clear
vision
pun
intend
of
what
stori
hi
sequel
would
tell
in
fact
he
had
idea
for
the
aveng

befor
he
even
began
shoot
it
predecessor
like
everi
comic
book
aficionado
whedon
who
s
written
a
varieti
of
book
for
marvel
in
the
past
ha
hi
own
favorit
super
hero
and
villain
and
when
we
visit
the
set
of
age
of
ultron
last
summer
he
told
us
he
knew
he
want
to
make
a
movi
where
paul
bettani
the
voic
of
j
a
r
v
i
s
iron
man
1

and
aveng
play
vision
befor
he
even
start
on
the
aveng
similarli
whedon
also
want
to
includ
the
brother
sister
act
of
quicksilv
and
scarlet
witch
earli
in
the
process
and
includ
all
of
these
new
charact
alongsid
the
villain
ultron
all
four
newcom
howev
will
appear
on
screen
with
slightli
differ
origin
stori
than
their
marvel
comic
counterpart
here
we
re
go
to
focu
on
ultron
and
explain
not
onli
how
he
s
go
to
be
differ
in
the
marvel
cinemat
univers
but
whi
he
s
differ
thi
is
a
followup
to
our
previou
ultron
introduct
explain
articl
ultron
s
earli
concept
in
the
film
when
the
age
of
ultron
subtitl
wa
reveal
for
the
aveng
followup
joss
whedon
explain
that
the
titular
villain
would
have
a
new
origin
stori
in
the
film
he
need
to
becaus
in
the
comic
hank
pym
the
first
ant
man
and
co
founder
of
the
aveng
creat
ultron
and
moviego
won
t
meet
pym
until
ant
man
open
in
theater
after
age
of
ultron
noth
can
be
translat
exactli
as
it
wa
from
the
comic
particularli
ultron
whedon
explain
in
2013
when
hint
that
ultron
s
live
action
film
introduct
would
stem
instead
from
what
fan
have
seen
in
the
movi
so
far
we
theoriz
the
obviou
solut
that
toni
stark
robert
downey
jr
would
creat
ultron
like
pym
and
bruce
banner
mark
ruffalo
stark
is
a
geniu
scientist
an
inventor
special
in
tech
and
given
how
the
stori
of
iron
man
3
play
out
with
stark
build
and
then
destroy
a
legion
of
autom
iron
man
suit
it
s
onli
logic
that
after
the
fall
of
s
h
i
e
l
d
the
world
s
number
one
line
of
defens
against
the
other
worldli
and
extraordinari
in
captain
america
the
winter
soldier
stark
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
continu
privat
world
peac
with
an
iron
man
esqu
polic
forc
thi
might
have
been
the
plan
all
along
for
marvel
and
whedon
thi
is
what
whedon
told
us
june
2014
befor
i
took
the
first
job
i
said
well
i
don
t
know
if
i
m
right
for
thi
or
if
i
want
it
or
you
want
me
but
in
the
second
one
the
villain
ha
to
be
ultron
and
he
ha
to
creat
the
vision
and
then
um
that
ha
to
be
paul
bettani
laugh
i
mean
it
took
me
three
year
befor
i
could
tell
paul
that
i
d
had
that
convers
but
after
that
i
stop
i
wa
like
that
would
be
cool
if
there
s
you
know
if
you
have
ultron
and
you
have
vision
and
paul
play
him
and
scarlet
witch
and
pietro
definit
they
re
from
my
era
they
re
veri
differ
their
power
are
differ
it
s
not
all
punch
it
give
a
differ
palett
we
can
do
more
interest
thing
it
s
fun
those
thing
were
all
yeah
those
were
absolut
and
a
few
month
earlier
in
april
2014
whedon
said
someth
similar
to
empir
also
explain
whi
jame
spader
the
blacklist
wa
the
perfect
cast
choic
to
help
bring
ultron
to
life
on
the
big
screen
befor
i
took
the
first
movi
for
me
what
wa
interest
is
that
he
is
thi
angri
and
i
hire
the
smoothest
talker
in
hollywood
to
play
him
i
did
it
on
purpos
i
need
a
guy
who
can
give
you
the
morpheu
but
then
can
just
lose
hi
shit
spader
s
realli
good
at
that
and
he
s
realli
good
at
find
the
dark
but
also
the
comedi
the
comedi
is
alway
a
huge
thing
for
me
tom
hiddleston
is
hilari
hiddleston
can
turn
on
a
dime
which
is
my
favorit
thing
he
can
be
absolut
apocalypt
and
then
um
point
of
order
ultron
ha
the
same
thing
he
is
veri
differ
obvious
in
hi
rhythm
and
hi
concept
but
for
me
it
s
a
guy
who
s
that
angri
and
who
hate
the
aveng
that
much
and
is
also
a
robot
and
is
therefor
go
to
have
everi
issu
that
a
robot
s
go
to
have
with
human
anyway
there
s
a
