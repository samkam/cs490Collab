in

of
the
best
way
i
can
imagin
a
friend
record
the
entir
book
on
tape
and
for
a
coupl
month
i
play
the
tape
of
her
read
a
chapter
or
two
just
befor
i
fell
asleep
each
night
my
slow
exposur
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumst
may
have
influenc
my
percept
but
i
can
say
on
each
subsequ
reread
of
the
book
i
ve
come
to
appreci
it
more
you
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
stori
appar
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stori
he
would
tell
hi
children
and
it
still
can
easili
serv
that
purpos
but
the
rich
of
hi
charact
lead
to
mani
interest
analog
to
human
life
for
instanc
from
hazel
you
can
learn
profound
thing
about
leadership
throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
hazel
is
the
natur
born
leader
of
hi
group
of
rabbit
but
richard
adam
wa
veri
care
to
develop
thi
impress
through
charact
featur
rather
than
power
relat
the
contrast
is
clearli
intent
sinc
the
other
leader
of
the
book
achiev
leadership
statu
through
veri
differ
mean
mani
peopl
think
the
book
take
a
strong
stanc
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
import
to
recogn
the
book
give
thi
impress
not
through
structur
diatrib
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolv
out
of
charact
consider
and
out
of
the
stori
itself
thi
mean
that
the
result
is
far
more
complex
than
a
simpl
argument
for
instanc
although
gener
woundwort
may
be
seen
as
the
main
enemi
that
hazel
ha
to
deal
with
and
the
authoritarian
rabbit
is
portray
rather
neg
at
time
adam
quit
intent
add
some
detail
that
make
him
admir
to
the
other
rabbit
even
to
the
veri
end
a
diatrib
would
not
be
so
complex
fiver
is
anoth
great
charact
he
add
an
element
of
magic
to
the
stori
and
it
allow
adam
to
link
the
rabbit
he
describ
to
a
mythic
world
that
enter
into
the
stori
quit
frequent
one
can
almost
see
fiver
as
a
manifest
of
imagin
in
thi
world
big
wig
is
anoth
likabl
charact
and
the
stori
of
thi
rabbit
experi
in
efrafa
is
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
stori
besid
the
charact
the
descript
of
england
are
also
quit
acut
you
can
actual
track
the
cours
of
the
rabbit
on

sinc
adam
wa
care
to
describ
real
place
and
thing
that
attent
to
detail
is
often
miss
in
review
of
thi
book
final
the
thing
that
bring
all
these
featur
togeth
and
make
the
book
more
than
a
mere
stori
or
an
account
of
human
charact
or
a
diatrib
against
fascism
is
the
fact
that
adam
is
quit
consciou
of
the
fact
that
he
is
tell
the
stori
from
the
perspect
of
rabbit
the
challeng
they
face
are
rabbit
size
the
idea
about
the
extern

are
rabbitlik
the
philosoph
insight
seem
rabbit
and
adam
bring
mani
of
our
anthropomorph
idea
of
rabbit
togeth
with
the
realiti
of
rabbit
in
a
surprisingli
coher
fashion
i
suppos
the
book
can
be
seen
as
a
cultur
studi
of
an
imagin
rich
but
realist
rabbit
world
i
realiz
as
i
write
thi
review
that
mani

may
not
feel
the

way
about
the

as
i
do
it
doe
have
some
shortcom

femal
charact
onli
make

although
i

doe
show
some
sensit
in

depict

even
with
the
limit
i
would
recommend
the

not

the

on

the

they

and
it
s

they
fight

if

they
don

sit
down

set
their

they

anim
each

the

that

is
a
small
joy
to
see
among
mani
thing
which
i
found
lovabl
and
admir
in
the

protagonist
of

is
their
love
of

the

of

and
hi

are
sprinkl
throughout
the
main
narr
and
serv
as
inspir
and
entertain
for

and
as
a
way
to
find
courag
in
hard
time
a
review
in
the
new
statesman
prais
richard
adam
for
write
a
big
tens
picaresqu
stori
these
three
adject
probabl
best
describ
watership
down
peopl
have
seen
in
it
a
riff
on
the
oddysey
an
allegori
for
human
struggl
against
totalitarian
oppress
fascism
the
cold
war
but
at
it
heart
it
is
a
wonder
stori
about
a
group
of
rabbit
search
for
a
new
home
and
their
effort
at
establish
a
warren
they
provid
for
interest
protagonist
and
as
they
journey
goe
on
so
do
their
respect
role
develop
these
are
to
a
degre
archetyp
but
richard
adam
is
care
to
make
sure
that
each
rabbit
retain
it
individu
characterist
and
grow
as
the
stori
progress
relat
between
the
charact
are
not
black
and
white
as
in
mani
book
for
children
even
though
the
villain
figur
is
portray
with
obviou
neg
adam
make
an
effort
to
show
whi
it
would
be
influenti
and
admir
by
mani
other
rabbit
all
the
way
to
the
veri
end
occasion
adam
will
do
some
authori
intrus
and
explain
the
rabbit
habit
of
hi
protagonist
but
he
did
write
thi
book
base
on
the
stori
he
told
their
kid
and
they
probabl
ask
mani
question
concern
these
matter
as
most
kid
would
it
s
not
a
big
problem
at
all
and
can
actual
be
seen
a
nice
remind
about
the
root
of
watership

hide
spoiler
i
didn
t
realli
think
so
it
seem
like
it
had
been
too
easi
and
anticlimact
there
were
no
femal
charact
i
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
be
neg
and
destruct
wa
a
littl
too
easi
novelist
now
as
then
have
their
environment
impact
as
do
we
all
it
s
easi
to
suggest
that
human
are
degrad
their
environ
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
and
adam
make
no
effort
at
all
in
that
direct
littl
did
i
suspect
that
thi
wa
just
the
pre
ambl
to
a
tremend
adventur
in
which
thi
theme
would
be
drop
almost
entir
and
the
focu
would
shift
toward
question
of
leadership
govern
and
the
will
to
power
or
that
the
lack
of
femal
rabbit
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
wa
go
to
happen
next
now
a
bunch
of
talk
rabbit
should
realli
be
laughabl
but
they
realli
aren

how

is
to
rememb
that
they
are
rabbit
not
just
metamorphos
human
which
one
might
think
would
be
counter
product
but
turn
out
not
to
be
so
these
rabbit
behav
like
rabbit
and
where
human
cultur
attitud
conflict
with
the
gener
behaviour
of
rabbit
rabbit
behaviour
is
kept
rabbit
behaviour
is
also
describ
in
detail
from
a
posit
of
knowledg
but
here
s
what
make
the
whole
thing
realli
work
the
rabbit
have
a
languag
folk
tale
myth
legend
and
religion
all
their
own
the
floati
black
rabbit
from
the
film
symbolis
death
and
in
the
book
is
a
good
deal
less
floati
more
corpor
and
even
more
scari
thi
doesn
t
stop
the
vagu
promethean

of

take
him

that
merg

languag
that
is
convincingli
repres
religi
or

element
to
it
cultur
seem
to
me
to
be
a
common
factor
link
the
best
work
of
fantasi
and
what
is
more
fantast
than
a
bunch
of
talk
bunni
peopl
talk
about
world
build
in
relat
to
fantasi
and
sf
i
would
suggest
that
these
aspect
of
the
world
to
be
built
are
crucial
the
rabbit
languag
is
so
well

thi

there
are
hair

scene

a

that
should
be
read
with
survivor
s
eye
of
the
tiger
play
in
the
background
on
the
characteris
side
it
is
worth
note
that
the
rabbit
in
thi
book
are
not
anthropomorph
anim
they
do
not
wear
cloth
drive
car
watch
tv
etc
yet
there
is
also
much
human
in
their
rabbitri
they
can
be
compassion
love
kind
cruel
egotist
melancholi
etc
these
human
trait
are
believ
portray
as
rabbit
trait
through
the
incred
talent
of
richard
adam
the
prose
is
absolut
beauti
with

that
they
enjoy
the

but
what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof
against
it
for
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
they
have
fire
and
warm
cloth
the
winter
cannot
hurt
them
and
therefor
increas
their
sens
of
clever
and
secur
for
bird
and
anim
as
for
poor
men
winter
is
anoth
matter
to
further
distinguish

isn

what
i

thi
is
a
matur

it
is
realist
and
honest
about
the
rabbit
s

in
the
world
and
it
certainli
doesn

shi
away
from
the
realiti
of

i

crush
tragedi

what

wa

thi
i

can

at

in

attribut

my

the

i
guess
that
in

about
a

of
rabbit
it
could
be
easi
to
mistak
one
for
the
other
not
in
thi

each
of
the
main
rabbit
ha
a
distinct
charact
and
throughout
the
book
i
found
that
i
actual
realli
care
about
them
i
can
t
realli
say
much
more
about
the
charact
without
give
the
storylin
away
but
suffic
to
say
that
it
wa
a
rollercoast
of
emot
the
stori
carri
deeper
mean
than
just
a
stori
about
rabbit
it
s
a
tale
of
surviv
team
work
friendship
and
persever
i
think
that
thi
messag
is
a
valid
one
for

alik
and
that
at

everyon
should
read

narra

sparuto
di
conigli
che
grazi
al
famoso
intuito
di
uno
di
essi
scappano
in
tempo
dalla
loro
conigliera
prima
che
questa
venga
sterminata
da
alcuni
uomini
che
vogliono
costruirci
sopra
il
viaggio
appar
lunghissimo
ma
è
in
realtà
molto
breve
il
lettor
è
subito
spinto
a
ragionar
in
termini
coniglieschi
e
anch
la
concezion
del
tempo
cambia
prima
di
giunger
al
coll
watership
dove
decidono
di
costruir
la
loro
nuova
casa
questo
gruppo
di
conigli
incapperà
in
pericoli
più
o
meno
grandi
attraverso
i
loro
occhi
vediamo
il
mondo
da
un
altra
prospettiva
una
prospettiva
che
con
la
nostra
non
ha
nulla
a
che
fare
e
grazi
a
questo
possiamo
imparar
a
capir
un
po
di
più
la
natura
fors
anch
a
rispettarla
inquietant
è
l
episodio
della
conigliera
maledetta
questo
posto
sembra
molto
accoglient
ma
i
conigli
in
realtà
sono
apatici
vivono
vicinissimi
agli
uomini
e
si
cibano
alla
grand
però
ogni
tanto
qualcuno
scompar
sono
troppo
abituati
a
questo
metodo
di
vita
a
questo
patto
uomo
coniglio
per
cambiar
le
cose
e
aprir
gli
occhi
dopo
questo
le
acqu
sembrano
calmarsi
finalment
i
conigli
hanno
trovato
la
loro
conigliera
vengono
raggiunti
da
due
sopravvissuti
alla
strage
della
loro
vecchia
casa
se
non
che
si
accorgono
di
esser
destinati
all
estinzion
nel
caso
non
provvedano
a
trovar
qualch
femmina
così
part
la
ricerca
anch
grazi
a
un
gabbiano
che
si
fanno
amico
con
l
intelligenza
del
loro
capo
moscardo
gli
unici
conigli
nei
paraggi
sono
quelli
domestici
chiusi
in
gabbia
di
una
fattoria
lì
vicino
gli
altri
appartengono
a
una
grandissima
conigliera
a
due
tre
giorni
di

per
questa
conigliera
moscardo
e
nicchio
un
altro
coniglio
tentano
una
sortita
alla
fattoria
per
veder
se
possono
fare
qualcosa
con
i
conigli
domestici
questi
sono
quattro
e
hanno
un
po
paura
a
seguirli
moscardo
promett
di
ritornar
molto
presto
mi
fermo
qui
nel
raccontar
l
episodio
perché
se
no
svelo
tutta
la
trama
tornando
alla
spedizion
per
la
grand
conigliera
che
dà
poi
vita
all
episodio
fulcro
del
romanzo
intendo
analizzar
attentament
la
società
di
quei
conigli
a

di
essi
c
è
il
general
vulneraria
semplic
coniglio
capo
no
trattasi
di
un
tiranno
ed
efrafa
la
sua
conigliera
non
è
altro
che
una
dittatura
oligarchica
qui
si
inserisc
il
tema
social
del
romanzo
e
spero
di
non
essermi
sbagliato
e
di
non
star
sparando
un
mare
di
stronzat
questa
società
conigliesca
è
retta
da
vulneraria
e
da
una
speci
di
aristocrazia
militar
chiamata
ausla
present
quasi
in
tutt
le
coniglier
ma
qui
con
poteri
praticament
assoluti
gli
orari
dei
conigli
sono
scanditi
regolarment
nessuno
se
ne
può
andar
chi
tenta
la
fuga
vien

ammazzato

se
arrivano
