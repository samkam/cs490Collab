the
order
in
which
the
narnia
chronicl
should
be
read
and
publish
is
a
matter
of
great
controversi
in
my
view
the
answer
to
thi
question
lie
in
a
proper
understand
of
the
deeper
level
of
narnia
when
read
on
an
adult
level
the
narnia
chronicl
function
as
a
power
medium
use
by
lewi
to
impart
power
spiritu
truth
about
christian
and
theolog
but
these
spiritu
truth
are
convey
more
by
biblic
allus
than
by
rigid
allegori
thi
also

implic
for
the
order

make

realli
were
intend
to
be
and
give
the
impress
that
they
are
an
extend
allegori
rather
than
incident
allus
an
incorrect
impress
in
my
view
despit
all
the
talk
about
allegori
it
seem
to
me
that
lewi
is
more
fond
of
incorpor
biblic
allus
where
and
when
he
pleas
rather
than

what
can
i
add
to
the
discuss
of
the
narnia
book
themselv
they
re
fantast
and
as
a
long
time
reader
of
lewi
s
work
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
s
hearten
to
see
that
new
gener
are
continu
to
discov
how
wonder
the
chronicl
of
narnia
are
just
as
i
did
about
20
year
ago
it
s
also
great
to
see
how
mani
adult
continu
to
treasur
them
just
as
i
do
today
the
onli
thing
i
would
say
to
first
time
reader
is
the
same
thing
that
a
lot
of
other
review
are
say
don
t
read
the
book
in
the
order
that
u
s
publish
are
put
them
out
these
day
lewi
alway
intend
the
narnia
book
to
be
publish
and
read
in
the
order
in
which
he
wrote
them
lww
pc
vdt
sc
hhb
mn
and
lb
it
s
true
that
near
the
end
of
hi
life
lewi
ponder
the
notion
of
have
the
book
publish
and
read
in
chronolog
order
but
onli
after
an
extens
set
of
intern
revis
as
it
turn
out
lewi
never
had
the
chanc
to
complet
those
revis
so
as
they
stand
now
the
book
realli
should
be
read
in
the
origin
sequenc
for
one
thing
that
s
the
onli
way
for
new
reader
to
discov
narnia
in
the
way
that
lewi
himself
discov
it
sinc
lewi
never
got
around
to
hi
intend
rewrit
the
overal
stori
unfold
much
more
meaning
and
much
more
dramat
when
it
s
read
out
of
order
for
instanc
part
of
the
enjoy
of
read
the
magician
s
nephew
is
realiz
just
how
a
land
that
the
reader
ha
alreadi
fallen
in
love
with
actual
came
into
be
there
s
an
almost
archaeolog
oh
now
i
understand
feel
to
it
if
you
read
mn
first
you
