thi
is
a

in

way
most
of
which
have

comment

brilliantli
by

review
i
would
therefor
like
to
restrict
my
comment
to
the
moral
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
thi
day
view
the
book
with
outrag
even
those
who
admir
the
book
somehow
feel
compel
to
comment
that
they
are
disturb
by
it
whi
is
thi
let
us
first
examin
the
novel
itself
as
everybodi
know
it
is
the
stori
of
humbert
humbert
a
full
grown
adult
male
not
an
old
man
who
seduc
a
compliant
twelv
year
old
girl
and
then
goe
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
affair
with
her
i
put
the
term
affair
in
quotat
mark
becaus
it
probabl
isn
t
appropri
to
describ
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
femal
child
in
such
term
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
ration
human
be
disapprov
of
such
relationship
it
is
certainli
safe
to
say
that
nabakov
and
