annabel
wa
like
the
writer
of
mix
parentag
half
english
half
dutch
in
her
case
i
rememb
her
featur
far
less
distinctli
today
than
i
did
a
few
year
ago
befor
i
knew
lolita
there
are
two
kind
of
visual
memori
one
when
you
skill
recreat
an
imag
in
the
laboratori
of
your
mind
with
your
eye
open
and
then
i
see
annabel
in
such
gener
term
as
honey
color
skin
thin
arm
brown
bob
hair
long
lash
big
bright
mouth
and
the
other
when
you
instantli
evok
with
shut
eye
on
the
dark
innersid
of
your
eyelid
the
object
absolut
optic
replica
of
a
belov
face
a
littl
ghost
in
natur
color
and
thi
is
how
i
see
lolita
let
me
therefor
primli
limit
myself
in
describ
annabel
to
say
she
wa
a
love
child
a
few
month
my
junior
her
parent
were
old
friend
of
my
aunt
s
and
as
stuffi
as
she
they
had
rent
a
villa
not
far
from
hotel
mirana
bald
brown
mr
leigh
and
fat
powder
mr
leigh
born
vanessa
van
ness
how
i
loath
them
at
first
annabel
and
i
talk
of
peripher
affair
she
kept
lift
hand
of
fine
sand
and
let
it
pour
through
her
finger
our
brain
were
turn
the
way
those
of
intellig
european
preadolesc
were
in
our
day
and
set
and
i
doubt
if
much
individu
geniu
should
be
assign
to
our
interest
in
the
plural
of
inhabit
world
competit
tenni
infin
solips
and
so
on
the
soft
and
fragil
of
babi
anim
caus
us
the
same
intens
pain
she
want
to
be
a
nurs
in
some
famish
asiat
countri
i
want
to
be
a
famou
spi
all
at
onc
we
were
madli
clumsili
shamelessli
agonizingli
in
love
with
each
other
hopelessli
i
should
add
becaus
that
frenzi
of
mutual
possess
might
have
been
assuag
onli
by
our
actual
imbib
and
assimil
everi
particl
of
each
other
s
soul
and
flesh
but
there
we
were
unabl
even
to
mate
as
slum
children
would
have
so
easili
found
an
opportun
to
do
after
one
wild
attempt
we
made
to
meet
at
night
in
her
garden
of
which
more
later
the
onli
privaci
we
were
allow
wa
to
be
out
of
earshot
but
not
out
of
sight
on
the
popul
part
of
the
plage
there
on
the
soft
sand
a
few
feet
away
from
our
elder
we
would
sprawl
all
morn
in
a
petrifi
paroxysm
of
desir
and
take
advantag
of
everi
bless
quirk
in
space
and
time
to
touch
each
other
her
hand
half
hidden
in
the
sand
would
creep
toward
me
it
slender
brown
finger
sleepwalk
nearer
and
nearer
then
her
opalesc
knee
would
start
on
a
long
cautiou
journey
sometim
a
chanc
rampart
built
by
younger
children
grant
us
suffici
conceal
to
graze
each
other
s
salti
lip
these
incomplet
contact
drove
our
healthi
and
inexperienc
young
bodi
to
such
a
state
of
exasper
that
not
even
the
cold
blue
water
under
which
we
still
claw
at
each
other
could
bring
relief
among
some
treasur
i
lost

the
wander
of
my
adult
year
there
wa
a

were
about
all
that

her
lost
loveli

and
just
a

befor
we
made
our
second
and
final
attempt
to
thwart
fate
under
the
flimsiest
of
pretext
thi
wa
our
veri
last
chanc
and
noth

matter
we
escap
from
the
cafe
to
the
beach
and
found
a
desol
stretch
of
sand
and
there
in
the
violet
shadow
of
some

rock
form
a

of

ask
myself
wa
it
then
in
the
glitter
of
that
remot
summer
that
the
rift
in
my

began
or

i
tri
to

which
feed
the

faculti
with
boundless
altern
and
which
caus
each
visual
rout
to
fork
and
re
fork
without
end
in
the
maddeningli
complex
prospect
of
my
past
i
am
convinc
howev
that
in
a
certain
magic
and
fate
way
lolita
began
with
annabel
i
also
know
that
the
shock
of
annabel
s
death
consolid
the
frustrat
of
that
nightmar
summer
made
of
it
a
perman
obstacl
to
ani
further
romanc
throughout
the
cold
year
of
my
youth
the
spiritu
and
the
physic
had
been
blend
in
us
with
a
perfect
that
must
remain
incomprehens
to
the
matter
of
fact
crude
standard
brain
youngster
of
today
long
after
her
death
i
felt
her
thought
float
through
mine
long
befor
we
met
we
had
had
the
same
dream
we
compar
note
we
found
strang
affin
the
same
june
of
the
same
year
1919
a
stray
canari
had
flutter
into
her
hous
and
mine
in
two
wide
separ
countri
oh
lolita
had
you
love
me
thu
i
have
reserv
for
the
conclus
of
my
annabel
phase
the
account
of
our
unsuccess
first
tryst
one
night
she
manag
to
deceiv
the
viciou
vigil
of
her
famili
in
a
nervou
and
slender
leav
mimosa
grove
at
the
back
of
their
villa
we
found
a
perch
on
the
ruin
of
a
low
stone
wall
through
the
dark
and
the
tender
tree
we
could
see
the
arabesqu
of
light
window
which
touch
up
by
the
color
ink
of
sensit
memori
appear
to
me
now
like
play
card
presum
becaus
a
bridg
game
wa
keep
the
enemi
busi
she
trembl
and
twitch
as
i
kiss
the
corner
of
her
part
lip
and
the
hot
lobe
of
her
ear
a
cluster
of
star
pale
glow
abov
us
between
the
silhouett
of
long
thin
leav
that
vibrant
sky
seem
as
nake
as
she
wa
under
her
light
frock
i
saw
her
face
in
the
sky
strang
distinct
as
if
it
emit
a
faint
radianc
of
it
own
her
leg
her
love
live
leg
were
not
too
close
togeth
and
when
my
hand
locat
what
it
sought
a
dreami
and
eeri
express
half
pleasur
half
pain
came
over
those
childish
featur
she
sat
a
littl
higher
than
i
and
whenev
in
her
solitari
ecstasi
she
wa
led
to
kiss
me
her
head
would
bend
with
a
sleepi
soft
droop
movement
that
wa
almost
woeful
and
her
bare
knee
caught
and
compress
my
wrist
and
slacken
again
and
her
quiver
mouth
distort
by
the
acrid
of
some
mysteri
potion
with
a
sibil
intak
of
breath
came
near
to
my
face
she
would
tri
to
reliev
the
pain
of
love
by
first
roughli
rub
her
dri
lip
against
mine
then
my
darl
would
draw
away
with
a
nervou
toss
of
her
hair
and
then
again
come
darkli
near
and
let
me
feed
on
her
open
mouth
while
with
a
generos
that
wa
readi
to
offer
her
everyth
my
heart
my
throat
my
entrail
i
gave
her
to
hold
in
her
awkward
fist
the
scepter
of
my
passion
i
recal
the
scent
of
some
kind
of
toilet
powder
i
believ
she
stole
it
from
her
mother
s
spanish
maid
a
sweetish
lowli
muski
perfum
it
mingl
with
her
own
biscuiti
odor
and
my
sens
were
suddenli

in

bush
prevent
them
from
overflow
and
as
we
drew
away
from
each
