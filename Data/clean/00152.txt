take

thi
in

is
the
real
stori
of

the

is
about
the
way
in

while
in

earlier
thi
summer
i
happili
got
a
chanc
to
see
the

form
my
own
opinion
the
first
of
which
is
thi
dominiqu

is
stun

a
seductress

the
veri
next

terrifi
the
film
is
lushli

what
the

humbert
humbert
is
not
to

thi
is
i

one
of
the
fundament

between
the
novel
and

one
that

her
featur
far
less
distinctli
today
than
i
did
a
few
year
ago
befor
i
knew
lolita
there
are
two
kind
of
visual
memori
one
when
you
skill
recreat
an
imag
in
the
laboratori
of
your
mind
with
your
eye
open
and
then
i
see
annabel
in
such
gener
term
as
honey
color
skin
thin

brown
bob
hair
long
lash
big
bright
mouth
and
the
other
when
you
instantli
evok
with
shut

on
the
dark
innersid
of
your
eyelid
the
object
absolut
optic
replica
of
a
belov
face
a
littl
ghost
in
natur
color
and
thi
is
how
i
see
lolita
let
me
therefor
primli
limit
myself
in
describ
annabel
to
say
she
wa
a

child
a
few

my

let
it
pour
through

our

there
we

easili
found
an

there
on

a
few

away
from

would
sprawl
all

take
advantag

everi
bless

the

the

enough
to
make

more
from
thi
review
lolita
a
classic
and
one
that
i
had
place
in
my
list
for
a
long
while
now
and
just
never
dare
to
buy
as
nabokov
explain
through
hi
fiction
introduct
thi
book
is
not
pornograph
and
so
if
that
is
what
you
are
expect
you
better
put
the
book
down
and
go
read
someth
els
thi
is
in
fact
a
love
stori
not
to
say
it
is
not
a
mess
up
love
stori
becaus
it
is
about
a
fulli
adult
male
and
a
twelv
year
old
girl
which
regardless
of
how
you
look
at
it
is
all
sort
of
wrong
br
br
the
interest
thing
here
is
that
if
you
replac
pedophilia
with
just
about
ani
other
romanc
it
becom
one
hell
of
a
romant
concept
what
nabokov
ha
done
is
gone
for
the
jugular
and
touch
on
the
most
unaccept
of
taboo
and
in
turn
given
it
one
of
the
most
beauti
word
romanc
stori
but
i
do
underscor
the
romanc
which
initi
wa
begin
to
wear
on
me
while
thi
look
to
be
a
happi
stori
i
actual
consid
put
the
book
down
mostli
becaus
i
do
not
do
romanc
so
well
thi
too
nabokov
seem
to
have
plan
nice
becaus
just
as
i
though
thi
book
may
be
too
much
of
a
love
stori
for
me
the
author
throw
in
the
wrench
into
everyth
he
ha
method
built
up
and
in
my
opinion
that
save
the
stori
where
the
happi
end
seem
forev
ruin
and
the
mysteri
begin
br
br
have
now
finish

the
book
round
up
nice
it
doe
some
thing
with
languag
which
are
just
absolut
stun
and
while
i
could
do
with
a
littl
bit
less
of
romanc
and
a
bit
more
of
the
mysteri
i
do
think
thi
is
a

a
review
lolita
is
a
magnific
book
written
excel
by
a
superb
author
it
is
not
about
sex
as
i
believ
someon
name
lionel
trill
ha
note
it
is
not
pornograph
nor
sadist
the
book
is
about
a
man
who
love
cherish
and
live
for
hi
adopt
stepdaught
all
other
nymphet
of
humbert
humbert
s
are
just
mirag
imag
glass
that
you
cannot
touch
in
the
store
without
fear
of
break
it
but
lolita
wa
hi
one
true
love
and
he
punish
all
that
would
not
see
it
that
way
even
hi
fantasi
that
he
would
have
the
same
relat
with
lolita
s
daughter
and
her
granddaught
can
be
explain
he
thought
he
had
to
reincarn
her
in
anoth
form
due
to
hi
pedophiliac
crave
grant
humbert
wa
respons
for
the
death
of
lolita
s
mother
and
he
did
not
love
her
he
wa
not
even
a
true
pedophil
for
he
had
sex
with
both
hi
wive
and
that
wa
not
just
for
show
