<p><i><b>Watership Down</b></i> is a heroic fantasy/political allegory novel about a small group of rabbits, written by English author Richard Adams. Although the animals in the story live in their natural environment, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their own culture, language (Lapine), and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel recounts the rabbits' odyssey as they escape the destruction of their warren to seek a place in which to establish a new home, encountering perils and temptations along the way. Fiver, a small buck predicts the destruction of their birth warren (Sandleford Warren) and convinces his brother Hazel and several others to leave before the destruction takes place, having failed to convince the Sandleford Warren's Chief rabbit that they all ought to leave.

<p><br/><br/>Fiver has a dream that something<i> terrible</i> will happen to the warren, and he convinces Hazel that they <i>must</i><b> </b>go visit the Chief Rabbit<b>.</b> Hazel convinces a member of the Owsla (the strongest rabbits in a warren who surround the Chief Rabbit) named Bigwig to let them see the Chief Rabbit. Hazel tells him that Fiver is his brother, and Fiver tells the Chief Rabbit, called the Threarah (-rah is added to the name of a leader), of his premonition. However, Threarah ignores the warning and later scolds Bigwig for allowing them to interrupt his sleep. Hazel, Fiver, and two of their friends, Dandelion and Blackberry, are discussing the conversation with the Chief Rabbit when Bigwig comes up to the group. He informs them that he has left the Owsla and wants to leave the warren with them. Hazel says that they will leave that evening, at moonrise, and that they should try to convince other rabbits to come.<br/><br/>Hazel, Fiver, and Pipkin (a friend of Fiver's) wait for the other rabbits to arrive. Dandelion gets Hawkbit to come, and Blackberry brings Buckthorn, a large rabbit likely to soon be a member of the Owsla, and two other rabbits Hazel does not know, Acorn and Speedwell. They wait a while, and finally Bigwig comes with Silver, a large rabbit who recently joined the Owsla. Just before they leave, Captain Holly, leader of the Owsla, comes to arrest Bigwig because he believes they want to overthrow the Chief Rabbit. Bigwig attacks Holly and forces him to retreat. The rabbits leave.<br/><br/>The rabbits spend the night crawling through the woods, slowly and cautiously. Hazel leads them forward, going forward himself at times to make sure the way is safe. The rabbits grow exhausted, however, and they decide to rest. Hazel realizes they are tense and nervous, so he asks Dandelion to tell them a story.<br/><br/>Dandelion tells a story about El-ahrairah, the rabbit folk hero. The story goes that when the world was first made, all of the animals were friends and the rabbits populated the entire earth. But then Frith, the sun god who created the world, told El-ahrairah to stop his people from multiplying. El-ahrairah responds that his people are the strongest in the world. Frith then decides to trick El-ahrairah, and he tells all of the animals to come get a gift. To foxes, stoats, weasels, and many other animals Frith gave gifts of cunning and strength to hunt rabbits. El-ahrairah heard this and decided to hide as he realizes Lord Frith cannot be tricked. He began to dig a hole, but at that moment Frith came upon him. Frith, seeing, the rabbit asks if he has seen El-ahraira's as he has a gift to bestow upon him. The prince then tells him that he would be given the gift. So, Lord Frith blesses El-ahrairah's tail. The prince of the rabbits that he would have a thousand enemies, but that they would have to catch him, and that if his people were crafty they would survive.
</p><p>A lendri (badger) surprises the rabbits and they run away from it. Then they come to a river that Fiver decides they need to cross, but they are unsure if they can. To the rabbits the river seems immense, but on the other side are fields that look much better than they woods where they have been.<br/><br/>Hazel knows that the other rabbits may not want to cross the river, but Fiver tells him that they must. Bigwig wants to know what they are going to do, and Blackberry convinces him to swim across and take a look at the other side to make sure it is safe. Bigwig comes hurrying back to tell them that there is a dog loose in their wood. Hazel realizes they must get across, but Pipkin is hurt and will not be able to swim. Blackberry figures out a way to float Fiver and Pipkin on a piece of wood, and they all get across safely. Blackberry's discovery mystifies all of the other rabbits except Fiver, who understands what happened.<br/><br/>The rabbits come across a bean field and settle down there for a while to rest.
</p><p>The rabbits are awakened from their sleep by the sound of a gunshot, and they scatter all about the field. Hazel and Silver return to the spot where they were all sleeping, and slowly the others come back as well. They set off across the field, but Hazel soon stops when he sees a car coming along a road. He does not know about roads, and Bigwig explains to him that the hrududil (cars) are not dangerous during the day, but that at night their lights are so bright that they make it impossible to move.<br/><br/>The rabbits continue on for some time in unfamiliar terrain until Hawkbit, Acorn, and Speedwell come to Hazel and tells him that they want to go back. Hazel tells them how ridiculous such an idea is, and before he can explain why they cannot go back Fiver comes to talk to him. Bigwig yells at the three insubordinates. Fiver, in a trance, tells Hazel his vision of where they need to go, to some hills that are very far away. Fiver says they are in for trouble on the way but that they need to get to the hills. Hazel is dubious because of the distance and worried about what they will do. When Fiver comes to himself and asks what he was talking about Hazel tells him to forget it.<br/><br/>Hazel knows that Acorn, Speedwell, and Hawkbit are unhappy because of the way Bigwig has kept them in line, and he knows they need to rest and find a place to settle down. Although Hazel is unsure of himself, he promises he will take the others to a better place soon. They travel through difficult terrain for hours, and just when it seems they can go no further, they come upon a perfect field.<br/><br/>The rabbits laze about contentedly in the field and begin to scratch out a few holes. They do not work very seriously, however, since real digging; such as warrens and burrows, is done by does (female rabbits) and they are all bucks. Soon they see a strange rabbit looking at them. Hazel and Blackberry go to speak to him. The very large rabbit, who seems unconcerned that they wish to stay and comes over to meet the rest of the group, puzzles them. His name is Cowslip, and he invites them to stay in his warren, which has many empty burrows. He runs off before the rain comes, and the group talks it over. Everyone thinks that there is no danger, except Fiver, who believes they should stay away. Hazel decides they will go to Cowslip's warren.<br/><br/>Cowslip's warren is strangely conspicuous, and Hazel leads his rabbits down into it. They come to a huge burrow where all of the rabbits from the warren are gathered. Hazel's group quickly mixes among them, except Fiver, who sits apart. Hazel goes off with a rabbit named Strawberry, who tells him that they never have to deal with any elil (enemies), because the man who lives nearby often shoots them. Strawberry shows Hazel around but seems to dodge Hazel's questions and shows him a form of stone artwork that bewilders Hazel, as most rabbits do not create art. He realizes that Strawberry will not answer any question beginning with the word "where."<br/><br/>They return to the big hall and Hazel wants to talk to Blackberry alone. He tells Cowslip they are going to silflay (eat outside), but Cowslip tells them that they have plenty of food inside and that it is raining outside anyway. When Hazel insists, Cowslip laughs at them. Laughter is foreign to rabbits, and Hazel and Blackberry run outside, puzzled. They meet Pipkin and the three of them discuss how strange these rabbits seem to be. They go back downstairs and fall asleep.<br/><br/>The rabbits are awakened by Strawberry stamping and calling out to wake everyone. He explains that there is flayrah (good food) outside. The rabbits all go outside and find carrots in the field. They eat their fill, and then Cowslip explains how to carry some food back to the warren for later. Hazel sees the angry Fiver, who tells him that there is something unnatural about the warren. Fiver slept outside and will not join them, and Hazel is worried.<br/><br/>Hazel sees Bigwig later, and although they both agree the warren is strange, they have been treated well and they see no reason to alter things. Bigwig forces Fiver to come down into the burrow with them. The other rabbits ask for a story, and, after a discussion, Blackberry says that Hazel will describe their adventures. The rabbits are silent, and Hazel's group confers again and decides that Dandelion should tell another story of El-ahrairah.<br/><br/>In the great burrow, Dandelion tells the story of a time when El-ahrairah and his people were down on their luck and living in marshland where there was little food. El-ahrairah convinced Prince Rainbow, whom Frith had placed in charge of the world, to let his people out of the marshes if he could steal King Darzin's lettuces. King Darzin had a great animal kingdom and his lettuce garden was heavily guarded, but along with his friend Rabscuttle, the Captain of his Owsla, El-ahrairah pulled off the trick. And from that day on, rabbits could not be kept out of vegetable gardens, as they always had a trick for the occasion.<br/><br/>Hazel and his gang are sure that Dandelion has made a favorable impression because he has told a classic rabbit story and told it very well. However, they soon realize that the reception they have received is not very enthusiastic. They learn that these rabbits do not tell the traditional stories and that they believe that rabbits need dignity, not tricks. One of the new rabbits, Silverweed, a young poet, recites a disturbingly beautiful poem about movement and life, and it affects Fiver greatly. He writhes in agony and tries to escape only to injure the other rabbits. Hazel follows him out along with Bigwig. Fiver thinks they have come out with him because they also senses what the entire warren is a trap, but he is startled to learn that they are only upset because he may have endangered their relationship with Cowslip and the other rabbits. They bully Fiver into going back underground to sleep.<br/><br/>Hazel wakes up, realizes that Fiver is not there, and goes angrily with Bigwig to find him. Fiver tells them he is leaving. Hazel tells Bigwig he must go with Fiver a little way to hear what he has to say and to try to convince him to come back. Bigwig yells at Fiver because he believes that Fiver is acting foolish and teases him about his visions.<br/><br/>Bigwig turns to go back to the warren and gets caught in a snare. He struggles furiously until Hazel tells him he is in a snare and Bigwig mouths that they need to get the peg out. Fiver runs for help and brings the others. Blackberry finds the peg and they get it out, but Bigwig remains still and silent. They learn that Cowslip and all the others would not come help and that they ignored Fiver when he went for help. Hazel, believing Bigwig has died says a small prayer. Suddenly Bigwig gets up, claiming that he will go kill Cowslip.<br/><br/>The rabbits become enraged and go to kill the others, but Fiver silences them all and tells them the story he has pieced together. The snares are there for the rabbits, set out by the farmer who feeds them and protects them from elil. The rabbits know about the snares, but they pretend everything is all right and come up with art and poetry to pass their time. Fiver convinces them the warren is a death trap, and they are about to leave when Strawberry comes running up and begs them to take him with them. Hazel agrees and they leave.<br/><br/>By the evening of the next day, the rabbits have travelled over three miles. They trust each other more after their experience in the last warren, and Fiver's intuitions are no longer questioned. They rest in a barn where they are attacked by rats, but Silver and Buckthorn fight them off under Bigwig's guidance. Finally the rabbits come to the foot of the downs, and Fiver wants them to climb up to the top. Hazel, Dandelion, and Hawkbit go ahead and scope out the territory. Hazel and Dandelion find that the top of the downs is perfect for them, and Hawkbit finds some rabbit holes on the way up that will be great places for them to sleep that night.<br/><br/>The rabbits sleep well that night. The next day, Blackberry suggests to Hazel that they build a warren for themselves. Although this is normally a task for does, not bucks, they decide that it is a good idea anyway and begin working. Later, Hazel, Bigwig, Dandelion, and Speedwell go down the hill to find some good grass. Soon they hear a terrible sound, one that they cannot place. They hide together, but then the voice begins to speak words, and it calls Bigwig. Shocked, Hazel bravely goes to see what it could be. With Dandelion behind him, he finds a rabbit in terrible shape, on the verge of collapse—it is Captain Holly of the Sandleford Owsla, from their home warren.<br/><br/>Hazel realizes that they are in danger, as the injured Holly smells of blood and will attract predators. Soon, another rabbit appears—Holly's friend Bluebell. Hazel manages to get Holly and Bluebell up to the top of the down without any trouble, although it takes a while and he is very worried. Pipkin and Dandelion take the two injured rabbits into one of the holes and tell the others to leave them be to rest as much as they need.<br/><br/>The next day, Hazel takes the others back to continue digging the new warren, which he wants to have a great burrow like the one in Strawberry's old warren. Soon, Strawberry takes control of the building process, using his knowledge from the other warren to help build the great burrow, which they call the Honeycomb. Hazel saves a mouse from a falcon by telling it (in the simple woodland language) to come down into one of their holes.<br/><br/>Captain Holly has recovered enough to tell them his story—one that he warns will drive fear into all of their hearts—but before he does so, the mouse speaks to Hazel. The mouse promises to help Hazel sometime in return for saving his life earlier.<br/><br/>Holly tells them that after they left, the Threarah explained that even if Fiver were right in his premonition, to move an entire warren is a tremendous undertaking. The Threarah pointed out that it is almost always better to stay underground and try to dodge the dangers than to pick up and leave, as many rabbits could not make a long journey, and predators would come from far around.<br/><br/>A few days later, Holly was out on his own, and when he came back he saw a group of men and a boy with a gun. The men filled in many of the holes and then put poisonous gas into each of the holes they had left open. Bluebell picks up the story and describes the terror inside the burrows. Rabbits panicked and mothers fought with any who came near their young. Bluebell managed to find a path that went far down into the earth and came out of a hole in the woods, along with another rabbit, Pimpernel, who was in bad shape.<br/><br/>Before they escaped, Holly tells them a great plough came and destroyed the field. Then, with the two other rabbits, he followed the path that Hazel had taken. The trail lead them near the warren of the snares, where they took shelter in a small ditch. Upon awakening they are surrounded by Cowslip and the others who attacked them and managed to kill Pimpernel, who was sick, and unable to defend himself but Holly and Bluebell managed to escape. Holly attacked Cowslip and would have killed him, but Cowslip told him where Hazel and the others had gone. They went on without sleeping, and by the end Holly was delirious and hallucinating. It was at that point that Hazel found him.<br/><br/>After Holly's story is finished, Hazel begins to clean his ear out and tells them why he saved the mouse. He figures that it cannot hurt to befriend other animals who are enemies of their enemies. They go out to eat, and Hawkbit tells Hazel that another mouse told him of a place where there is very good grass to eat. They go eat, and Hazel is pleased that helping the mouse paid off.<br/><br/>Bluebell then tells a story about El-ahrairah that took place soon after the story that Dandelion told about the King's Lettuce. Prince Rainbow wanted to put El-ahrairah back in his place, so he brought a rabbit named Hufsa to live with him and made Rabscuttle live somewhere else. Hufsa spoiled all of El-ahrairah's plans by secretly telling Prince Rainbow about them. El- ahrairah finally tricked Hufsa into looking like a fool, and managed to steal Prince Rainbow's new carrots in the process. He went with Hufsa to steal the carrots, but made so many other animals do so many strange things along the way that no one believed Hufsa's story at the trial. The jury, made up entirely of elil—the enemies of rabbits—acquitted El-ahrairah, and Prince Rainbow took Hufsa away. Bigwig and Silver find an injured bird in a hollow. The bird is a black- headed gull, something the rabbits have never seen before. Hazel goes with them to look at the bird, talks to it in the same dialect that he used with the mouse, and decides that it is hungry. They collect worms and other insects and bring them to the gull. After feeding the bird, Hazel tries to convince it that they want to help it. The bird wants nothing to do with them, however, so they leave.<br/><br/>Later that afternoon, Hazel convinces the bird to come and stay in a hole that they could build for it. While the other rabbits dig the hole, Hazel explains to the bird the way they live. By the next day, the bird is much better and much friendlier, and Bigwig becomes its constant companion. Bigwig tells the others that a cat injured the bird's wing, and that the bird comes from a place far away where the earth stops and is followed by so much water that no land can be seen. The rabbits are impressed and incredulous, but Bigwig is sure the bird, whose name is Kehaar, is not lying.<br/><br/>As they learn about the bird, Hazel tells the others of his plan. He points out that they have no does in the warren and, unless they find some, their new warren will have been built in vain. Hazel wants Kehaar to find some does, as the bird can travel farther much faster than the rabbits could. Bigwig says he will work on it.<br/><br/>A few days later, when Kehaar is better, he comes to Hazel and presents his plan—the bird will go and find females for the rabbits. Kehaar leaves and returns after several days, telling them that there are rabbits in a farm at the bottom of the hill. He also tells of a warren he found that would take them a few days to reach. They decide to send an expedition to the warren to try to bring back some does. Holly, Silver, Buckthorn, and Strawberry set off the next morning.<br/><br/>That night, Hazel decides that he should see about securing a few does before the expedition comes back. He sets off with Pipkin to look at the rabbits on the farm. Inside the shed with the rabbits, Hazel has Pipkin keep watch for cats while Hazel talks to the rabbits. He meets Boxwood, who tells him there are two does and two bucks. Hazel tells them he wants them to join the warren, and he promises to come back and free them. Just then, Pipkin warns him that a cat is outside. Hazel waits for the cat to approach and then goads it into jumping at them. The rabbits take off, getting away just in the nick of time. Pipkin asks Hazel why he went to talk to the rabbits, and Hazel says that he will explain later.<br/><br/>The next day, Fiver finds out about Hazel's adventure to the farm, and Fiver is angry because he believes that Holly will bring back plenty of does and that Hazel is simply acting like a show-off. Hazel disagrees with his brother, and later on he and Pipkin tell the others about the visit. Bigwig is excited to go, and he and Hazel convince Blackberry to come with them to figure out how to open the rabbit hutch. Dandelion, Speedwell, and Hawkbit are also to go along. Fiver warns Hazel that he foresees danger for him, so Hazel promises he will not go into the farmyard himself.<br/><br/>They leave the next evening. At the end of the barn, the rabbits stumble upon a cat (different from the one Hazel and Pipkin met earlier). Dandelion scratches the cat only a moment before Bigwig hits it, rolls over it, and kicks it several times, sending the cat running. Blackberry figures out a way to rip the leather hinge, and they free the other rabbits. But the rabbits in the hutch are not certain whether to follow the others or not. Two of them, Boxwood and Clover, try to move quickly, but the other two, Haystack and Laurel, hang back. Soon the other cat arrives and the dog begins barking. The rabbits run off, leaving Laurel behind.<br/><br/>They get to Hazel, who tells them to continue on. Hazel goes back with Dandelion to get the other two. Suddenly a car pulls up, blinding the rabbits with light. The men grab Laurel, and the other rabbits run off. While the men search, the rabbits get stuck in a ditch. Hazel runs out to distract the men so the others can get away, and he is shot. He crawls up the drain and hides.<br/><br/>The other rabbits gather together and wait for Hazel, and then Dandelion and Bigwig go down to look for him. They see the blood and the men's footsteps, and they go back to tell the others. The rabbits make the march back to the downs to meet Fiver, who already knows about Hazel's ordeal from a vision. Later that night, Holly comes back with Buckthorn, Strawberry, and Silver. Only Silver is unhurt. The rabbits have no does with them.<br/><br/>Fiver has a dream in which he learns that Hazel is still alive. Fiver asks Blackberry if he knows where Hazel was shot, and he tells Blackberry to take him to that spot. Even though Blackberry is sure that Hazel must be dead, Fiver convinces him to go. They return to the farm, Fiver rushing as fast as he can and telling Blackberry to hurry up. Fiver moves through the ditch and follows the trail of blood to the drain. He looks in the drain and sees that Hazel is inside, and that he is still alive.<br/><br/>Deprived of their leader, the rabbits are uncertain of themselves and do not know what to do. Holly tells the story of what happened on their journey to the warren that Kehaar told them about. They bumped into a rabbit who told them not to go to Efrafa (the warren), but just then three big rabbits approached them and escorted them in.<br/><br/>The Owsla in Efrafa are in complete control, along with a council of advisers (Owsla), and a rabbit named General Woundwort is the leader. Each of the rabbits is marked and then put in a group with a similar mark, and they only go above ground with their group. The warren is designed to avoid detection because the rabbits fear humans. The Owsla run a "Wide Patrol"—they move far away from the warren looking for enemies or wandering rabbits.<br/><br/>A rabbit called Captain Campion took Holly and the others into a burrow, where they learned about the warren by talking to the rabbits, especially a doe named Hyzenthlay, who told them that the warren was overcrowded. They were brought before the Council, and Holly tried to explain that they just wanted a few does for their own warren. However, General Woundwort explained to them that they were to stay in Efrafa—they quickly realized that they were prisoners, not guests.<br/><br/>Holly came up with a plan to escape, and they ran away while their guard was eating outside. They were soon pursued, however, and they knew they would be overtaken. Only climbing over one side of a railroad track saved them, although Holly did not know what the track was. The train came through and cut them off from the Efrafan Owsla. Holly describes the train as a giant hrududu sent by Lord Frith himself to save them. They managed to make their way back to the warren, only to learn that Hazel was killed in the raid on the barn.<br/><br/>Blackberry comes and tells them that Hazel is alive and that he is with Fiver at the bottom of the hill. Bigwig runs down to help and finds Hazel sleeping. The next morning, Kehaar comes down and pulls the shotgun pellets out of Hazel's leg. Hazel spends three days resting and tells Holly and the rest what they need to do. They need to return to Efrafa and bring back some does, and Hazel wants Blackberry to figure out how to do it.<br/><br/>Hazel returns the next morning and tells the rabbits that he plans to go to Efrafa and get some does. Holly speaks out against the plan, saying it is suicide. But then Fiver says that he will go and claims that he thinks it will work. Bigwig also says that he is going and that Kehaar is coming with them. Silver and Pipkin volunteer, and then Blackberry comes in and says that the plan is better than he originally thought. Kehaar tells Hazel he will help them to find the does, but that he must leave afterwards. He promises to return another time in the future.<br/><br/>The rabbits set out on their quest for Efrafan does, leaving behind only Buckthorn, Strawberry, Holly, and the hutch rabbits. Hazel wants to find a hiding place close to Efrafa, and Kehaar comes and tells him they can hide on the other side of the nearby river. They ask Dandelion to tell a story, and Bigwig requests El-ahrairah and the Black Rabbit of Inlé.<br/><br/>Dandelion tells the story of a time when King Darzin sent his soldiers to get rid of El-ahrairah once and for all. The soldiers attacked the rabbits as soon as they came out of their holes, and soon all of El-ahrairah's people were miserable. El-ahrairah could not figure out a way to get rid of King Darzin, and he realized he needed special help. He decided to seek out the Black Rabbit of Inlé, an immortal rabbit appointed by Lord Frith to determine the deaths of all rabbits. El-ahrairah wanted to offer the Black Rabbit his own life in exchange for help for his people.<br/><br/>After a long journey with his friend Rabscuttle, El-ahrairah came to the dwelling of the Black Rabbit and tried to bargain with him, but the Black Rabbit would not accept his offer. El-ahrairah tried to trick the Black Rabbit, but he lost his whiskers, his tail, and his ears in the process. Finally, the Black Rabbit told El-ahrairah to leave, and said that he had already gotten rid of King Darzin's soldiers. Rabscuttle and El-ahrairah made their way home, getting lost and having many adventures on the way. When they finally returned, the warren was bigger and the younger rabbits knew nothing about the war with King Darzin. In fact, they thought war itself was foolish. El-ahrairah sat to think, and Lord Frith came to talk to him, telling him that wisdom is not easy, and brought him a tail, whiskers, and a pair of ears with starlight in them. Just then, Pipkin interrupts the story to tell the others that there is a fox approaching.<br/><br/>Hazel gathers everyone to run from the fox, but just at that moment Bigwig rushes past him, draws the fox's attention, and runs into the undergrowth. They hear a rabbit squeal and then, surprisingly, Bigwig comes running back. Hazel is angry with him, but Bigwig says he needed to do something because he was very tense. He tells Hazel that when he went into the brush with the fox behind him, he bumped into three strange rabbits. He told them to run, but they tried to stop him, so he knocked one of them down and then ran off. He figures the fox must have gotten the rabbit that he knocked down.<br/><br/>The rabbits move on through the night. In the morning, Kehaar comes and tells them that there is a patrol nearby that will find them soon if they do not hide. They cross over the iron road—the railroad tracks—that Holly told them about, and Kehaar tells them they are safe. The rabbits go to sleep.<br/><br/>Hazel realizes that Bigwig's stunt with the fox probably broke up a Wide Patrol that was very close to finding them. He asks Kehaar to take them to the river, which is huge and awes the rabbits. The need to get to the other side, so Kehaar shows them the way to a bridge. Fiver reassures Hazel that the bridge is no worse than many other places they have been, and is in fact better than some. Fiver and Hazel go across first with Pipkin, and soon Silver and Dandelion follow. Many of the other rabbits are even more reluctant than Hazel to cross, and Fiver has to convince them all to come over. They check out the terrain and then sleep.<br/><br/>Blackberry and Hazel need to figure out the last step in the plan. They explore the other side of the river and find a smaller bridge further down the river. They cross it, along with Fiver, Bigwig, and Bluebell. They come upon a boat, which Kehaar explains to them, and Blackberry strikes upon using the boat themselves. The plan is complete, and Hazel tells Bigwig it is time for him to go. Bigwig pauses for a moment and then takes off.<br/><br/>General Woundwort is a huge, fearless rabbit who has fought many types of elil in the past. He created Efrafa because he craved power, and he fully controlled it from the beginning. He used the Wide Patrols to systematically gain control over the area surrounding Efrafa and he made his warren very safe. The patrols were also used to train rabbits to become fierce and cunning. Woundwort himself sometimes joins the patrols.<br/><br/>However, the General is concerned because Holly and his group's escape hurt the prestige of the Owsla and also caused the death of a good captain (the one who was hit by the train). Furthermore, the fox, led on by Bigwig, killed another of Woundwort's best officers. Captain Campion, one of Woundwort's officers, comes to tell him that they have found a rabbit who wants to join Efrafa.<br/><br/>The rabbit is Bigwig, although Woundwort does not know him. Bigwig convinces the General that he would be a good addition to the warren, and Woundwort makes him an officer.<br/><br/>Bigwig learns about the Efrafa security, and begins to think that his task may be close to hopeless. He meets the rabbit Blackavar, who tried to escape but was caught by Campion. Blackavar was hurt very badly, and he is left out as a public demonstration. Bigwig decides that if he brings anyone out, Blackavar is coming with them. Bigwig meets Hyzenthlay and some other does, and later he has her come to see him. He talks to Hyzenthlay and tells her that he plans to break some does out of Efrafa. She is intelligent and helpful and tells him that they must leave in the next two nights, because after that their Mark does not go out at night. They settle on the next night, and she is to tell the does just before they go out to eat.<br/><br/>One of the officers wakes Bigwig up, and he heads out to feed with his Mark. Outside, he sees Kehaar and, while eating, talks to the bird. He tells Kehaar that the rabbits must be ready at sunset and that he must attack the sentries. Bigwig goes to tell Hyzenthlay and her friend Thethutinnang about the plan. Just as Bigwig gets ready to make the break that night, General Woundwort calls him aside to talk to him.<br/><br/>Woundwort questions Bigwig because one of the officers from the patrol Bigwig encountered while running from the fox has recognized him. Bigwig explains to Woundwort that he did not bring the fox on them intentionally. Woundwort asks him if he knows anything about the other rabbits that his Patrol was tracking. Bigwig says that he saw their tracks, but otherwise has no idea where they went. Woundwort invites Bigwig to go on a Wide Patrol with him two days later and then tells him to keep an eye on Hyzenthlay because there may be more trouble.<br/><br/>Hazel and the other rabbits realize that something must have gone wrong. They return to the other side of the river, trying to keep their spirits up. Bigwig is very worried, and to add to his troubles he learns that Hyzenthlay and Thethutinnang have told the other does to be ready. He is worried that one of them will talk and that they will be found out. The next morning, Bigwig finds a way to send a message to Kehaar by using another officer as his unwitting pawn. He tells the bird to come back that night. Later, Bigwig finds Blackavar apart from his escort for a moment and tells him to be ready to break later that night.<br/><br/>Hazel and the others get Bigwig's message through Kehaar and prepare to meet him. Hyzenthlay wakes Bigwig up to tell him that a doe has been arrested. He tells her to gather the others quickly and goes to get Blackavar. Bigwig attacks one of Blackavar's escorts, while the prisoner fights with the other. Bigwig knocks down both escorts and then takes off with Blackavar and the does right behind him. They hear stamping and know that the Efrafans have spotted their escape.<br/><br/>Woundwort learns what has happened and takes off after them. Campion tries to get Bigwig to stop, but they continue on. Soon, however, the General and his men catch up to them. Just when the escapees turn to fight, lightning flashes, giving everyone pause. It begins to pour, and then Kehaar attacks out of nowhere. The other rabbits come to Bigwig and the does' aid, and they make a hasty retreat towards the river.<br/><br/>Woundwort and his rabbits come at them from one side while Campion comes from the other. Now all the rabbits are on the boat except Dandelion, who is hiding in the bushes, and Woundwort comes to kill them all, injuring a doe, Thrayonsla, in the process, tearing the right side of her face off. Hazel says they must leave, but Bigwig cries out that Kehaar is there. Woundwort leaps back, and Dandelion jumps on the boat. The force breaks the already frayed rope, and the rabbits drift away from Woundwort and Efrafa.<br/><br/>The rabbits float down the river, wondering what to do next. Kehaar tells them that there is a bridge coming and that they might not fit under it. They squeeze through the bridge, but one of the does is hurt as they go under. They come to another bridge that stops the boat. Kehaar tells them to jump out and swim underneath the bridge, and he does so himself just to show them that it is safe. Hazel does not know whether Kehaar’s advice is sound for rabbits, but then a group of men passes over the bridge and Hazel realizes how unsafe their position is. He and Pipkin jump into the water, and Blackavar follows behind them. Once safe on land, Blackavar points out that they can walk around to the other side. From there they tell the others that it is safe to jump. Although some of the does need convincing, they finally all jump in, drift to the shore, and fall asleep.<br/><br/>In the morning they learn that the doe who was injured, Thrayonsla, going under the bridge has died during the night. Hazel and Bigwig say goodbye to Kehaar, who takes off for the ocean, promising to return in the winter. Then the rabbits set off on the road home. Blackavar proves himself very useful because from his Efrafan training he knows how to track very well. At one point, Hazel wants to stop and dig some holes to stay in for a few days, and Fiver is not opposed to doing so. Blackavar feels that they are in fox country, but Bigwig disagrees and Hazel decides they should rest.<br/><br/>Two days later, a fox grabs one of the does. The group moves on. They stumble upon Captain Campion, who only sees a few of them and tries to get them to surrender, but soon realizes he is outnumbered. Hazel prepares to go past without any force, but Blackavar tells him they must kill the patrol or else it will report back to Efrafa. They move on without fighting and make their wake back to their warren at the downs. Campion and his patrol, who have looped back behind them, see the warren and then go back to Efrafa to report.<br/><br/>Everyone is content in the warren. The sixteen bucks manage to get along with only ten does, and they are all pleased to be once again living normal rabbit lives. They persuade Dandelion to tell them a story, and he tells them about the time that El-ahrairah and Rabscuttle played a trick on Rowsby Woof, a vicious dog, so that they could eat some good food. El-ahrairah dressed up and pretended to be the Fairy Wogdog, a spirit sent by the Dog Queen. El-ahrairah and Rabscuttle got their food and left Rowsby Woof convinced that he saved both his master and the Fairy Wogdog from an evil rat spirit.<br/><br/>After Dandelion finishes his story, he goes to take over the sentry post from Acorn. Hazel goes with him and is visited by his mouse friend, who brings news of other rabbits gathered close by. Bigwig wants to talk to Hazel and ignores the mouse, but Hazel asks the mouse to repeat its message and then insists on sending Holly and Blackavar to check. Speedwell comes out happily to tell them that Clover has had a litter of six kittens.<br/><br/>Bigwig chats happily with Hazel, but then Holly and Blackavar come running back. They bring news that a huge raiding party has come from Efrafa. They have bumped into Campion and they think Woundwort himself may be there. Hazel decides to fill in the holes leading into the burrows so their enemies will have to dig them out, leaving one hole open to enter and exit. Hazel decides to go try to talk to General Woundwort, and he makes Bigwig Chief Rabbit until he returns.<br/><br/>We learn that Woundwort's authority was damaged after Bigwig engineered the great escape, and he was determined to get revenge. He set up Campion to look for the escapees at the spot where the fox ruined their earlier patrol. After learning where the warren was, he set up an expedition.<br/><br/>Once Woundwort learns that the rabbits have been spotted, he takes a few of his own rabbits with him to look at what the enemy is doing. Hazel comes forward and offers a compromise. He suggests that they create a warren between Efrafa and the downs, made up of rabbits from each warren. Woundwort barely considers Hazel's offer before telling him that if all the does, Blackavar, and Bigwig are not waiting when he gets there, then he will kill all of the bucks.<br/><br/>While the Efrafans struggle to get through, Bigwig suggests to Hazel that they move everyone into the burrows behind the Honeycomb and then block the entrances. That way once they are in, the Efrafans will have to get through Bigwig to get to the rest of the warren. Fiver falls into some sort of trance, screams, and Hazel has a vision: he needs to go to the farm and free the dog. He takes Blackberry and Dandelion with him and they fly out of the open hole.<br/><br/>Woundwort moves down into the burrow and prepares to attack. Bigwig has had to leave Fiver on the other side because he would not wake up, but Woundwort thinks Fiver is dead and leaves him alone. Woundwort brings in more rabbits, and they see the newly formed wall at one end of the hall. When they break through, Woundwort steps in first, and Bigwig, who has buried himself below the entrance, bites deep into the General's leg. Woundwort scratches back and then advance. Bigwig rips into the leg again, but then Woundwort comes down on top of him and takes control. Just as Woundwort goes for the kill, his leg gives out and he falls backward, receiving a few blows from Bigwig as he moves back.<br/><br/>Dandelion takes off with the dog behind him. After a brief rest in the cattle shed, he manages to keep the dog following him up to where Blackberry is waiting. He draws the dog out of the gate, but then it seems to lose interest. Finally it starts up the hill at a slow trot. Dandelion catches up, and together the two rabbits get the dog's attention. It charges after them.<br/><br/>Woundwort tries to get Bigwig to move, but Bigwig knows that even his dead body will be a major obstacle, as it will block the way. Finally Woundwort jumps at Bigwig and pushes him backwards. Bigwig struggles, but is slowly pushed back, when suddenly Woundwort loses strength. Bigwig's blows have caused Woundwort's nose to bleed, and he cannot breathe as he tries pushing Bigwig. Finally the General lets go and retreats. His troops are incredulous, and when he sends one rabbit (Vervain) in to finish off Bigwig, the rabbit is too scared to go and makes up an excuse of having grit in his eye. Woundwort decides to work from another angle, leaving Bigwig there. He goes above ground to work out a new digging plan. Just then, Campion comes running and screams for them all to flee. The dog appears, running fast, and only Woundwort stands his ground, urging the others to stay and fight.<br/><br/>Lucy, the little girl who lives on the farm, hears squealing and rescues Hazel from her cat. She wants to show the hurt rabbit to the doctor, who comes over just as the dog comes back, with a bad scratch on his nose and a bite on his leg. The doctor says the rabbit is fine, and he offers to give Lucy a ride to somewhere they can let it go. She lets it go right at the base of Watership Down.<br/><br/>Woundwort's standing up to the dog has probably saved the lives of many rabbits by giving them time to run away. Campion decides that the Efrafans should go home, and managed to make it back with only six or seven rabbits. Several Efrafans ran into the hole when the dog came and surrendered immediately to Fiver. Bigwig is hurt badly, but he seems to recover, and Hazel comes running up to tell his story.<br/><br/>It is October, and two more of the does, Hyzenthlay (Hazel's mate) and Vilthuril (Fiver's mate), have had litters, and everyone is living well. The Efrafans who surrendered have joined the warren and get along fine, although they believe Woundwort is still alive somewhere. Hazel thinks they should start a new warren between theirs and Efrafa. The young kittens are growing up, hearing stories of adventure and receiving training from Bigwig in how to attack cats.<br/><br/>Several years later, a new warren, Vlevflain, was started and things went well with all three warrens. Woundwort was never seen again, but his legend lived on. Hazel has lived long, much longer than rabbits live. One cold morning in March, a rabbit with shining light in his ears comes for Hazel. They walk out into the day, and Hazel leaves his body behind him, looking back only to see that all is well before moving on to his new world.<br/>

<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Bigwig" title="Bigwig">Bigwig</a>- Bigwig is a large and strong rabbit known for the tuft of hair on his head. His lapine name is 'Thlayli' which, translated literally, means 'fur-head'. He was part of the Sandleford Owsla with his friend Silver. He, with several others left with Hazel and Fiver. Because of his stubborn nature Hazel hesitated at first to bring him along, thinking Bigwig might want to be Chief Rabbit, a bully, and trouble maker. Luckily for all Bigwig left with them anyway and proved to be one of the most valuable members of the party. Bigwig is notably the strongest of the Sandleford rabbits and an accomplished fighter. He survives two normally fatal situations, being snared in Cowslip's Warren and a brutal fight with General Woundwort, and is very brave.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Hazel" title="Hazel">Hazel</a>- Hazel (or by his followers, Hazel-rah) is a brave and true buck, the central character in Richard Adams's fantasy novel Watership Down. He was born in the Sandleford Warren, but decides to leave at the advice from his brother, Fiver, that it would be destroyed and the fact that he was not being well treated, left his birth place. Ultimately destined to be Chief Rabbit of the Watership Down Warren, he leads several rabbits out of Sandleford including Bigwig and Pipkin. Trusting in Fiver, Hazel leads the rabbits on many adventures before eventually finding Watership Down. On the way, he earns their trust and loyalty with is quick decisions, relying on the talents of his companions, and understanding nature. With his ability to cultivate the best in everyone around him, the rabbits suceed with his leadership as he makes the most of each of their abilities.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Fiver" title="Fiver">Fiver</a>- Fiver is a main character in Richard Adams', Watership Down. He was born in a warren at Sandleford, and is the younger brother of Hazel. Fiver's Lapine name, literally "little thousand" comes from the fact that he was the smallest rabbit of at least five in his litter. We are told that rabbits cannot count beyond four, so all numbers greater than this are hrair, or "thousand", although in this case Adams renders it into English as "five". He is also clairvoyant which allows him to sense when when there is danger.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Blackberry" title="Blackberry">Blackberry</a>- Blackberry is a rabbit with characteristically black-tipped ears and a part of the group who left Sandleford Warren for Watership Down. Blackberry is very clever and cunning rabbit and can often come up with things that others can not. He realizes, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to traverse on water. But his ideas are often too difficult for other rabbits to understand, although Fiver always appreciates them at their true value. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan for a way to rescue does from Efrafa. Blackberry is also a very good runner, that's why Hazel chose him to lead a dog to Watership Down.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Hyzenthlay" title="Hyzenthlay">Hyzenthlay</a>- Hyzenthlay was an Efrafan doe and one of the representative leaders of a group who unsuccessfully tried to convince General Woundwort to allow herself and some other does to leave the warren due to overcrowding. When Bigwig infiltrated Efrafa, secretly planning to help some does escape, he befriends Hyzenthlay. She is described as sensible and strong and able to think on her own account, just what Bigwig needs in a friend during this dangerous mission. Lead by Bigwig, she is one of the rabbits who escapes along with Blackavar and other Efrafan does to live in the Watership Down Warren. After the escape, the Battle of Watership Down took place soon after they returned to Watership Down Warren. The Watership rabbits won the Battle against Efrafa. She also forsees Hazel's ride in a hrududu.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Kehaar" title="Kehaar">Kehaar</a> - Black-headed Gull injured by a cat who befriends Bigwig. Kehaar is instrumental to the survival of Watership Down by first scouting out Efrafa for locating does, and then helping Bigwig escape General Woundwort.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Thethutinnang" title="Thethutinnang">Thethutinnang</a>- Thethutinnang is another doe from Efrfa who escaped from the warren with Bigwig's help, and about ten or eleven other does. When they return to Watership Down, she becomes Bigwig's mate after the final conflict with Efrafa.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Vilthuril" title="Vilthuril">Vilthuril</a>- Vilthuril is a doe born in Efrafa who is liberated by Bigwig, and becomes Fiver's mate some time after her escape. She is one of the two does that gives birth to litters (the other being Hyzenthlay to Hazel's litter) after the final conflict with Efrafa.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Blackavar" title="Blackavar">Blackavar</a>- He is a savaged buck from Efrafa who is the only buck liberated by Bigwig from his home warren. He proves to be an expert tracker and fighter, and takes part in the final conflict against the Efrafans.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Dandelion" title="Dandelion">Dandelion</a>- Dandelion is one of the Sandleford Warren survivors. He is a yellow-furred rabbit, hence his name. He is Watership Down's resident storyteller, having collected several stories about El-ahrairah and Lord Frith. He is also rather of a smart mouth. He always makes a joke when someone says something out of the ordinary, and he talks back to everyone. He is good friends with Hawkbit and Blackberry. He is also the fastest runner, next to Blackberry, out of all the other Watership Down Warren rabbits.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Hawkbit" title="Hawkbit">Hawkbit</a>- Hawkbit was a rabbit that came from Sandleford Warren to Watership Down along with the other Watership rabbits. He was a very serious rabbit who always talked negatively towards things. He is also good friends with Acorn, Speedwell, Buckthorn, and Dandelion.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Silver" title="Silver">Silver</a>- Silver was a rabbit that was an officer of the Sandleford Owsla of the Sandleford Warren. According to Bigwig the other Owsla officers teased him for only getting the job because Silver was Threarah's nephew, but Bigwig and Silver would always show them who was weak by fighting them. Bigwig brought him along on the journey because they were good friends from the Sandleford Owsla.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Pipkin" title="Pipkin">Pipkin</a>- Pipkin or Hlao-Roo was an undersized rabbit that went with Fiver and Hazel. He was a really good friend of Fiver's because they grew up in the same position as being the runts of Sandleford, and when Fiver said that he is going to leave the Sandleford Warren Pipkin immediately decided that he wanted to come with him.. He was usually the rabbit that was afraid and weak in most circumstances. He and Fiver share those characteristics.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Clover" title="Clover">Clover</a>- Clover is one of the Hutch Rabbits from Nuthanger Farm that joined the Watership Down Warren. She is a strong and active Angora doe, who mated with Speedwell and provides the Watership Down warren with its first litter. The other Hutch Rabbits were, Boxwood, Haystack, and Laurel.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Strawberry" title="Strawberry">Strawberry</a>- Strawberry was a buck from Cowslip's Warren and was large but a dandy, as was typical of Cowslip's Warren rabbits. His doe, named Nildro-hain, is killed in a snare. When Hazel and the other Sandleford Warren Survivors left the Warren of Snares, Strawberry begs to join them. Hazel agrees that he can join the group. Although Hazel notices that Strawberry has a harder time traveling, he was said to have never complained and arrived with the others when they found the Watership Down Warren. He was also instrumental in the design of the Watership Down warren.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holly" title="Holly">Captain Holly</a>- Holly was a rabbit who was part of the Owsla. He tried to arrest Bigwig and the rest of the rabbits who were trying to leave but Bigwig and some others attacked him. Hazel told him if he did not go then they would kill him. He, Bluebell, Pimpernel, and Toadflax were also the last survivors of the Sandleford Warren when the men destroyed it. They left the destroyed warren, and Toadflax soon died. They ran into the Warren of Snares where the Snare Rabbits ambushed them and killed Pimpernel. Cowslip injured Holly but Holly threatened to kill Cowslip if he didn't tell him where Bigwig and Hazel were. Cowslip told them that they were on Watership Down. Holly scratched his Cowslip's eye, and he and Bluebell fled to the Down. On the Down Bluebell sensed danger. He tried to get Holly to move but he couldn't, so he fled to a bush. Holly called out to Bigwig and shouted, "Zorn!" Bigwig though it was the Black Rabbit of Inle, so he was afraid, but he went up never the less, and found Holly. Holly, Silver , Buckthorn , and Strawberry, all went to Efrafa to get does and bring them back to Watership Down. But they failed and came back with no does. Holly had another wound, Strawberry was ill from exhaustion, and Buckthorn was wounded in the face.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Buckthorn" title="Buckthorn">Buckthorn</a>- Buckthorn was a rabbit who came to the Watership Down Warren from the Sandleford Warren. He was a strong rabbit who was about to join the Sandleford Owsla when he reached full weight. He was injured by a rat while the group was resting in a barn. Buckthorn, along with Holly, Strawberry, and Silver, went to Efrafa to ask if they could have a few does join their warren. He later joined the Watership Down Owsla. He was a tough, sturdy rabbit with a quiet and easygoing nature. Like Silver, he is steadfast and dependable in a crisis
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Speedwell" title="Speedwell">Speedwell</a>- Speedwell was a rabbit who originated from Sandleford Warren. He left the Warren with Hazel, Fiver, Pipkin, Bigwig, Hawkbit, Dandelion, Blackberry, Silver, Acorn, and Buckthorn, to start there own warren which eventually came to be known as The Watership Down Warren. Speedwell is subsequently characterised as an energetic, easy-going joker who later makes a loyal and hard-working contribution to the defence of the warren against General Woundwort.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Bluebell" title="Bluebell">Bluebell</a>- Bluebell was one of the survivors of the Sandleford Warren. He, Holly, Pimpernel, and Toadflax escaped. But Toadflax soon died after they left Sandleford. They soon ran into the Warren of Snares, where they were ambushed by the Warren's chief, Cowslip, and his people, who killed Pimpernel. Holly cornered Cowslip and threatened to kill him if he didn't tell him where Hazel and Bigwig were.He said that they were on Watership Down. When they got up on the Down, Bluebell sensed what he thought to be elil coming towards them. Bluebell couldn't get Holly to move, so he fled into a bush. Holly shouted "ZORN!" and called Bigwig's name. Bigwig heard his calls, but he though that it was the Black Rabbit of Inle. He went up anyway and found Bluebell and Holly. So Bluebell and Holly were welcomed into the Watership Down Warren as brethren.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">Acorn</a>- Acorn was one of the original rabbits that left the Sandleford Warren with Hazel and Fiver. He was good friends with Speedwell, Buckthorn, and Hawkbit. Acorn is mentioned as being one of the most skilled rabbits when it comes to gathering bugs for the wounded Kehaar, and is unflaggingly loyal to Hazel in the battle of the warren against General Woundwort.
