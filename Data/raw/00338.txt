It is the most confusing and pointless of the Star Wars films. Is it entertaining? Yes, at time. But mostly it’s just complete shit compared to the simplicity, originality, and development the original trilogy had. Everything this guy said was completely valid, regardless of which films you prefer. I personally like this film, but for illogical reasons. This movie is bad. This is the worst Star Wars movie. Those are facts he has just proven. </p>

<p>What? When the big final battle takes place, they’re almost entirely fighting regiments of DROIDS. The term “battle-hardened” refers to someone who has been through numerous wars and conflicts and has had their sensitivities, resilience, and training steeled over as a result. Usually this person is pretty valuable in a fight. “Battle-hardened” would be appropriate if you were referring to like, a human, or some other type of carbon-based life form that could experience things like fear, pain, or emotion. But these are FUCKING ROBOTS. The most “life-like” thing they do is say “Roger, roger” back to the giant computer that probably controls them. They’re not the fucking Uruk-hai. </p>
<p>Besides, from the way the Jedi cut these things in half by the dozen, I’d say they’re pretty expendable…not valuable. They’re like cheap plastic toys that all look the same (cue “We’re in the money” music). As soon as one gets demolished it just gets replaced by another on that looks exactly the same and has the same orders. They don’t need to be “battle-hardened” from numerous conflicts.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-8278"><p>IMHO<br/>
1.  When you have a story that can’t really hold up to a complicated scrutiny of plot details like SW (as opposed to Star Trek which can work as a nerd niche), you really have to focus on universal elements of storytelling and visuals, you can’t just have a bunch of mindless logistical dialogue that creates all these new rules.  That’s why this is ‘Fantasy in space’ as opposed to sci-fi; it’s supposed to be fucking universal and accessible!!!</p>
<p>2.  Anakin should have been the Luke of the prequels, starting ep1 the same age as Luke in epIV.  Lucas could have just aped the sequels and no one would have faulted him.  No one wanted Godfather here, just SW.  Making the character of Anakin switch actors 33% of the way through the trilogy is absolutely mind boggling;  obviously the reasoning was,” Now it gots a little kid!” The closest I can get to identifying a protagonist in this mess is<br/>
ep1:  Obiwan, Qui-gon, and Anakin are ALL the protagonist.<br/>
ep2:  Obiwan and Anakin are both the protagonist.<br/>
ep3: Anakin is the Protagonist</p>
<p>3.  Anakin and Obiwan’s friendship doesn’t make very much sense due to their age difference of… I’ll say at least 10 years.  Actually the way these movies work it’s almost as if Anakin catches up in age to Obiwan.</p>
<p>This movie is 13 years old and I still can’t forget how much of a clusterfuck it was.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-10492"><p>The prequels are such a colossal failure because they lack the most basic elements that make a movie worth watching.  It lacks characters and a coherent story.  It’s as if they took all the old star wars staples and ELECTROFIED them.  They didn’t bother with a story or characters.  It’s totally obvious.</p>
<p>I’m not a writer and I could have made a better story.  Here’s something just off the top of my head.  It wouldn’t be that hard to do and it ties up the story nicely to coincide with the start of A New Hope.</p>
<p>Obiwan is a younger, more hotheaded Jedi than in the original trilogy.  He finds Anakin and wants to train him because he senses his potential with the Force.  When he asks the permission of the Jedi council they deny him the opportunity, so he trains him in secret.  Yoda finds out that Obiwan is secretly training Anakin and has Anakin brought into the Jedi order so Obiwan doesn’t get into trouble.  </p>
<p>Anakin advances through his training quickly.  He becomes more and more powerful, but he’s reckless and prone to giving in to his emotions.  The council is wary of this and slows his training and ascent through the ranks.  Anakin starts to become impatient with the council always doubting him.  He believes they’re jealous and scared of his true potential.  Palpatine talks to Anakin, tells him that there is another group that uses the Force that would allow him to advance much quicker and to attain even greater power with the Force.  </p>
<p>Anakin slowly turns to the dark side becoming more and more distant to the Jedi order.  Obiwan realizes this and eventually finds out that Anakin is consorting with a Sith lord.  He eventually confronts Anakin and duels him in an effort to stop him.  Obiwan wins the duel but can’t bring himself to kill Anakin.  Instead he leaves him severely maimed, hoping that this will stop his quest for power.  This is where Anakin becomes Darth Vader.  Filled with hatred for the Jedi, particularly his old friend Obiwan, he works with Palpatine to eliminate the Jedi council (as they’re the only group that has any real power to oppose him).  </p>
<p>All the Jedi are hunted down and eliminated, only a few manage to escape.  Obiwan takes baby Luke and heads off to Tatooine, leaving baby Leia to the Organas on Alderaan.  He does this out of fear that Darth Vader’s children would be equally as powerful with the Force and that they’d be corrupted to the dark side.  He goes into hiding on Tatooine so he can watch Luke while avoiding being killed in the ensuing hunt for the remaining Jedi.  He also hides out of shame for having brought the end of the Jedi order, which had existed for thousands of generations.  Yoda flees to Dagobah because he fears the Jedi order is destroyed and there is nothing else he can do to change that.</p>
<p>Fill that basic outline with scenes depicting Obiwan and Anakin going through adventures and you’d have a much better trilogy. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-10721"><p>I really like the three old movies because of the story and the great idea, but what captured my attention in the star wars saga was exactly what isn’t considered so good: the action. Although it does not fit well in the universe of star wars the paper of the action in the new trilogy is to attract the new audience making it justified. And what sabotages the new movies is the numbers of details that were tried to be put in the movie because of the lack of answers in the old trilogy. They put a lot of details because they needed not only to tell a new story but to explain an already existed one, this makes difficult to conceal and the problems are seen more easily. As a 17 years old nerd I would put the films in this order: worst – I, III, IV, II, V, VI -best. I would put this in my opinion (that nobody needs to share if you don’t will to) because of the action involved and the story.<br/>
And in the problems in the story appeared not only in the new trilogy, who would put a week point in a massive weapon like the death star?? Why there is a hole that take it to the reactor?? It doesn’t makes sense at all.  </p>

<p>I know everyone refers to Star Wars as some immaculate and flawless trilogy of sci-fi perfection, but have any of you seen ROTJ recently?</p>
<p>Episode IV was breathtaking and revolutionary, Episode V picked up from where it left off and added an intensity the first was missing and delved deeper into the themes and characters Star Wars created, then Episode VI came along and fucked everything up. </p>
<p>You’ve done an excellent job of explaining why Episodes I-III are unbearable pieces of shit, so why omit Return of the Jedi? That movie is the worst of the OT by FAR and I’d argue the worst of the saga. The only reason an adult would enjoy that movie is if they saw it as a child and are incapable of viewing it objectively. All of the terrible qualities of the prequels are there. Go and give it a rewatch, I implore you.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-11238"><p>Your alternative is generic and highly cliche, but coherent and understandable. At its core, Lucas’ script for Episodes I, II, and III is very much the same. It’s generic and not particularly clever, but it’s coherent. Think about it; if I simplified the story to its most basic elements, we’d get something that sounds as palatable as your own proposal.</p>
<p>Obi Wan is a young, somewhat impulsive Jedi being mentored by Li’emni Sohn, a powerful Jedi master. While traveling a barren desert world they stumble across a young boy named Anakin whose innate potential with the force is so great that it astonishes both of them. Obi-Wan senses that he is destined for great things and covets the chance to be the one who trains him, allowing his desire to do so to cloud his normally sound judgment.</p>
<p>The young Anakin grows in power but as he enters his tumultuous adolescence he chafes under what he feels is the oppression of the Jedi order. At the core of his rebellion is a disagreement; the Jedi Order demands that its adherents master and suppress their emotion, because failure to do so has led Jedi in the past to wield their power to do horrible things in pursuit of their passions. Anakin does not understand this and wouldn’t agree with it even if he did. All he sees is that the order is trying to keep him from the woman he loves passionately. He carries on his quiet rebellion out of the sights of the Jedi order. Some of the higher-ups know, but keep their eyes half-shut, because on some level they feel the code is too strict, as well.</p>
<p>Anakin grows in power and begins to perceive new subtleties in the force. One day, tapping deeply into it, he has a vision that terrifies him, of his beautiful wife dying. He refuses to accept that this is true. He fights to try to find a way around it. Everything he knows about the force suggests that what he’s seen is unavoidable. Finally, he’s faced with a choice; accept that his wife has to die, or throw away every shred of the things he’s been taught in a desperate bid that on the other side of the force, the side he’s been taught is evil, there may be an answer for him. Meanwhile, on the other side, a very powerful and intelligent evil sees this and senses an opportunity to turn one of the most powerful Jedi ever produced into his loyal servant. All he has to do is lie and tell the young man that on the dark side, there really IS a way to save his wife. And so Anikin allows himself to be corrupted, and by the time he realizes what is happening, he’s too late to change what he’s become, or the horrible things he has done. He wakes to find he’s a slave to a new master.</p>
<p>Fill that basic outline with scenes depicting Obiwan and Anakin going through adventures and you’d have a pretty decent trilogy… or, well, you might. The problem is not the basic plot idea that Lucas used. The problem is how he fleshed it out. He took the simple, central narrative of the first three episodes, which could have been brilliant in the hands of somebody who cared about things like logic and coherency, and buried it under several layers of shit, neglect, and bad acting. He made no apparent effort to screen it for internal contradictions, apparently never asked himself if the characters were believable, and didn’t bother to go out of his way to bring a great performance out of the actors. And he did this because he is, at hart, an effects man. He loves graphics. He wanted to build a wonderful and complex world, and to use computer graphics to create a visual cinematic experience that was like nothing seen before. And he did that, and brilliantly. But in his rush to do that, he thought he could get away with neglecting the other half of the movie–the story that ties it all together. And that’s where he fell apart, and why I hate the first trilogy so much. Anakin’s desperate battle against fate isn’t the problem. It’s that Lucas makes him act so insipid and stupid that the audience feels he turned to the dark side because he was a whiny man-bitch, and not because he was a desperate and brilliant Jedi who was, at heart, just a boy trying to save the girl he loved. Lucas didn’t treat a single plot idea he had with the respect it deserved. And he (and the rest of us) paid for it.</p>

It’s a bit generic, (and I don’t mean that in a rude way), and predicated on the idea that Anakin was kind of rotten to begin with, but it’s coherent and I think that you’re absolutely right that it would have made a good framework for the first three episodes, if it was treated properly. I get the feeling that Lucas wanted to play up the tragic hero angle, and that’s why he went the direction he did.</p>
<p>But I do disagree with you about one strong point. I don’t think that the problem with Star Wars I, II, and III is the central narrative. At its core, Lucas’ script for Episodes I, II, and III is very much the same as your own. It’s coherent and understandable and could serve as the basis for a great film, but only if treated properly. Think about it; if I simplified the story to its most basic elements, we’d get something that sounds as palatable as your own proposal. Something like this:</p>

<p>Think about your own idea for a moment. Would you have trusted Lucas with that idea, if you knew he was going to give your basic narrative the same treatment that he did to his own? The same insipid characters, poor acting, contrived motivations and situations?</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-11341"><p>I think the worst parts are the endless droning on in Luke and Vader’s lightsaber battle.   It was trying to build suspense but it just got boring.  And, also I don’t mind the ewoks as much as most, but they should have played a smaller role.  That being said, the speeder chase in the forest was pretty cool.  And what you said about seeing it as a kid, I saw both the old trilogy (on VHS, not the shitty remade DVD’s), and the prequels as a kid.  Personally, I think that people give the prequels too much shit, and that they had too high of expectations going into it.</p>
<p>Also, my personal favorite is ESB.  It is the most thoughtful, and conflicted one.</p>

And I know he’s an acquired taste but esp. if your a painter – Greenaway’s movies are a visual candy shop. Since the Disney buyout and discussions about the next possible film, I’ve encountered some “thru the eyes of a child”  apologists for this trope fest.  Just needed a reminder that I wasn’t losing mind.  This is a terrible movie and needs to be remembered as such. Besides Maul the only redeeming quality of PM  is that comparatively, it makes the Ewoks bearable.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-11935"><p>The fact that the droids get cut down like butter is only a problem if you look at TPM as a stand alone movie – and everyone in the audience knew they were seeing only 1/3rd of a trilogy.<br/>
1) the seeming superiority of the Jedi. What makes their eventual fall so dramatic is the destruction of their status as nearly invincible figures. This has to happen out of order from the original trilogy in order to make narrative sense. The Jedi start with power and lose to evil, rather than start as goodie underdogs. It’s OK that their primary opponents are incompetent in the first movie, since you’ve already accepted that you are in for a trilogy. Faulting this aspect of the first film after the whole trilogy was a failure is unfair.</p>
<p>2) The superiority of the clones versus droids. Ever wonder why the Empire would bother training and using live humans (or at least humanoids) under those stormtrooper outfits, rather than mass produce a bunch of robots? I certainly wondered that as a kid. This was actually a clever way to answer that question, by showing the incompetence and unreliability of the mass produced machine and eventual necessity of the mass produced cloned soldier. </p>
<p>3) Queens are more exciting than rooks. The lack of tension throughout the film was the result of mostly absent villains and a long drought of story spent on the silly pod race. What would a more competent droid army accomplish? The audience isn’t there to watch the conflict with the droids – they are there for the conflict with the Sith, the story of Luke and Leia’s birth, and Anakin’s descent into the Dark Side. The fact that very little of the story has any relevance to these conflicts is more damning than whether the droids were worthy adversaries. </p>
<p>Love the reviews!!! Just disagree on a few things. <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://redlettermedia.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/></p>

After the 6’th movie there was an invasion by a species that TURNS PLANETS INTO ORGANIC SHIPS IN A MATTER OF DAYS!  If Palpatine knew this in advance then it’d be freaking genius to overthrow the republic to PROTECT IT.  Jesus Christ look how retarded both the senate and the Jedi are in dealing with a bunch of fucking retarded droids.  The Empire has trillions of troops and has a station that can BLOW UP motherfucking planets, ya know, ones that could’ve been turned into genocidal spaceships.  But yeah, the sith are the bad guys, the rebellion just caused the genocides of a dozen or so species.</p>

scenes.  The first sequel could be thrown out entirely and it wouldn’t<br/>

<p>He told a story<br/>

watered down the story so that it is hard to follow and understand.</p>

Like they could make Anakin secretly have a crush on Senator Padme who is organizing a counter-alliance against the Trade Federation and gets kidnapped by the apprentice Sith because Palpatine is backing the Trade Federation to destroy the Republic from within, so Anakin will agree to help the Republic save Padme using the alias ‘Darth Vader’ so the Jedi won’t know, but he’s not powerful enough to do it, and Palpatine is drawn by his Force and his immense rage and convinces him to become his apprentice with the promise of godlike power without realizing that this will result in the death of his other apprentice, and this causes Anakin to become Darth Vader permanently, and also married to Padme and worshipped by the Republic as their savior, so Palpatine decides to abandon the Trade Federation and use his new apprentice to weasel his way into the Republic, meanwhile the Jedi have figured out the Darth Vader thing by now and come to stop it but Anakin personally slaughters them all, except Yoda who’s too powerful and Obi-Wan who was the only Jedi he actually knew personally, but using that much Force in one battle nearly kills him so the Republic builds him the suit, and the two remaining Jedis flee and turn the Trade Federation into the Rebel Alliance, eventually joined by Padme who flees with her and Anakin’s kids when Palpatine turns the Republic into the Empire.</p>

<p>dear butthurt basement dweller: it helps to actually explain and rationalize your accusations and criticisms of a movie. not bring up a point and immediately cut away to some long winded rant that only serves to make fun of it, never once delivering any message or comparative reasoning to support your original point.</p>
<p>when you actually do manage to make a reasonable point, you fail to realize that it is just another COMMON movie fallacy. on this note, for every whining you have against TPM, I could find the same criticism in the original trilogy. it was full of just as many tropes and irrational decisions… the only difference is you choose to deny that out of fandom.</p>
<p>this isn’t any sort of a review, it’s an hour of you crying because you don’t like anything new. the mere fact you went into seeing this movie with an already preconceived notion that it was going to suck, should be reason enough to dismiss any possibility of sound criticism.</p>

<p>Ewan McGregor played Obi-Wan.<br/>
Character Description; (Jinn) Wise, tempered and a great role model for initiates and full knights alike. Loyal and obedient not willing to deviate far from orders. (Ammadella) Dedicated, Kind hearted, brave and wise for her age. Not afraid to fight for her people or cause.<br/>
Wasn’t hard. Next time ask people that are not retarded.<br/>
Honestly, your point on the opening scene of No.4 is valid but otherwise you’re a whining fanboy. If you’re distracted by background things; up your ADHD medication…<br/>
“I don’t understand space stuff…” Really? Your lack of understanding is the fault of the film. </p>
<p>I found all three as enjoyable as the original trilogy, in some regards better, in some worse. You fanboys would never be happy with what ever is put out, so just stick on the original VHS and stop ‘reviewing’ shit; you’re ill equipped for such a task.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-16675"><p>Interesting approach.  I would not start Episode I with Obi Wan as a Jedi.  I would reach back further to his line in to Yoda in ‘Empire Strikes Back’ – ‘Was I any different when you taught me?’  We have thus established that Yoda taught Obi Wan to be a Jedi.  Why abandon that?  Episode I should have been about Yoda discovering Obi Wan and training him to become a Jedi.  Then the Emperor tempts him with the Dark Side and he refuses.  Or something, as long as your fill out Obi Wan’s backstory.  But keep the focus on the core characters without introducing all the static.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-17131"><p>Oh, this is just great. A stupid review site full of nerdy stupid explanations trying to put some value to stupid flaws, just because they’re old.</p>
<p>Let’s just start once again the bullshit-counter job:</p>
<p>First of all, I’m not even start defending the script of Phantom Menace in general. It is a great movie with great story. I’ll just comment your reasons.</p>
<p>THE NEED OF A PROTAGONIST: the audience needs a protagonist? Who the hell told you that? You are bound to the past, where all action movies followed the very same linear structure, repeated over and over again due to lack of creativity. Only 1 person and his problems filling the whole picture.</p>
<p>The most stupid things on the older movies was the centering around Luke. Nobody knew shit about the rest of the galaxy. What is the Senate? Where is it? Empire of what? You see Dagobah, Hoth, Tattoine and Endor, and none of them has any trace of government. The only place you see that has the slight sign of administration is Bespin, and that’s not even an important place in the whole galaxy.</p>
<p> From that you have to imagine how is the rest of the galaxy. I remember that when I was a kid, most people used to think that the whole Empire was just an empire of spaceships that dominated underdeveloped planets, and that’s all (and the worst thing is that according to IV, V and VI, that’s acceptable).</p>
<p>Even more, the whole universe is at war but all you see is the adventures of Luke. How stupid is that? I can’t blame Lucas. He said himself that he regrets not having the tech or money to make the story as wide as it should be at the time. Centering on Luke is a limitation, not something to be praised. The I, II and III rightfully placed the characters stories below or at least in the same level as the rest of the universe, what should’ve been done to the IV, V and VI as well.</p>
<p>Sorry, but all I see here is someone complaining about not having a boring 1 person story, about a single individual saving the whole universe in his every move, what is really ridiculous to think even for a country what to say for a whole galaxy. I’m really glad that Lucas fixed that, and that now I can see that the whole galaxy is not made of 1 person.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTERS: I’ll pretty much get into your game.</p>
<p>Han Solo: he’s a rogue. He got a strange facial expression and keeps uninitentionally smilling due to lack of interpretation from H. Ford (that only do serious roles). All of his faces are overly expressed, like he is doing mimics, with too widely opened eyes (like japanese theater, wich is great, but totally incoherent for a movie). From the whole cast, he was the only one that made me see that it was an actor, not a character (always speaking as if there was a third person seeing him act).</p>
<p>Qui Gon: he is very calm and experienced. Know what to do even at the worst time possible, and is very patient. Everything is under his control but if something isn’t, he doesn’t mind breaking some rules and being a little rebel if he think it’s needed for a greater good. That just perfectly fits the personality Obi-Wan shows in the older movies. The only difference is that the old Obi-Wan is not a rebel in any way, since there is no Jedi Order.</p>
<p>C3PO: just a clown, nothing more. It is exactly the same role played by Jar Jar, or even by himself on the I, II and III.</p>
<p>Amidala: very serious and focused person. She can endure any hardship with the same fearless determination. She appears to have no feelings while leading her planet, but she is sweet, smart and corageus when she is not in the rule of queen os senator, and this is great.</p>
<p>Actually, I can’t even imagine a queen being any other way. What should she be? Sterical and stubborn like Leia? Her image is the same as Angela Merkel’s or Queen Elizabeth’s. Also, does everyone in your world must have a non-regular behaviour<br/>
somehow? Maybe you don’t know serious people, but they do exist.</p>
<p>Also, stop asking morons what they think about the sagas, ask someone that at least understood the movies.</p>
<p>Let’s just make another question game, shall we?</p>
<p> Describe the galaxy in the 2 trilogies without describing specifically any planet:</p>
<p>I, II and III: a bible of content.</p>
<p>IV, V and VI: …nothing, wait, …Hoth?</p>
<p>STORY: Let me see… the whole galaxy is at piece and you want a pointless action scene at the beginning of Phantom Menace? How ridiculous is that? You want action at the beginning? Watch Revenge of the Sith and fill your eyes with grandiosity and shame for ever having said that you’ve seen a great space battle before.</p>
<p>Asnwer me this: Based only in the IV, V and VI, how does the galaxy work? What does a Jedi do? The answer is silence, because THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE OLDER TRILOGY. I believe you thought that a Jedi would just go wherever crime is and destroy everyone, like a super hero (so naive if you’re more than 15yo). Lucas spent some time showing everyone what is the galaxy and what a Jedi do and all you can do is complain about not having a battle? Go watch Braddock, damn it!</p>
<p>The I, II and III are so full of iformation because the have to set their own background and the background of the older trilogy, that was so incomplete. The older trilogy could even be renamed to “The Space Adventures of Luke Skywalker” and IT WOULD FIT because there is nothing else to the movie!</p>
<p>Now try to do that to the new trilogy… You can’t, and you know why? Because there are many important facts and characters happening everywhere in the galaxy, covered all the time in different takes. The movie is rich. The real STAR WARS can only be seen in the I, II and III, because the old movies don’t have a galaxy, only 4 or 5 unexplored planets 1 moon and some teddy bears.</p>
<p>I’m stopping here, because if I go on, I’ll find much more flaws on your review (much more than I thought). But at least, I’ll just explain your point of view.</p>
<p>Back in the 70’s-80’s, science fiction wasn’t so explored as it is today, and that’s a great part of the success of A New Hope. The whole movie was like nothing you’ve ever seen before. The feeling that you must have felt when you saw it on the theater must have been incredible, almost impossible to describe. I envy you, for I’ve never seen those movies in a theather, since I was born in 1980.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that feeling clouded your judgement, because you expected the same feeling in the new saga, and that’s impossible, because science fiction and aliens are just a very commom subject today.</p>
<p>Also, you have the “oldman’s revolt”. I created the name, but It is a very well known syndrome where old people desperately try to enrich their youth to see it as fasr superior to today’s youth (even young people that hates nowadays life style can have that syndrome). That makes you love every single piece of shit from the past, even flaws and mistakes.</p>
<p>Because of that feeling, you tend to say that everything that was old is better, but look at yourself! You are complaining about the new movies because a queen does look like a queen and a Jedi Master does look like a Jedi Master. or even because you are being filled with information about the galaxy, politics, governments, species, knowledge… That’s just absurd. You praise the incomplete and despises what is well described.</p>
<p>I know this is not Lucas’ fault. He already said that he didn’t have the money or tech to make the old movies as wide as they should be, but limitiations are to be just respected, not praised, so I tend to overlook these flaws.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m really confident that I’m one of the biggest fans Star Wars will ever have, but even so, Its hard to let pass things like:</p>
<p>– Lack of good choreographers: this was responsible by horrible fight between Old Kenobi and Vader. Obi-Wan looked like an old man using a cane to scare off a dog and made me think that a Jedi was a piece of shit, lightsaber and all. That was not dramatic, but a shit fight. Also Han shaking his blaster while shooting is pretty ridiculous (looks like a kid saying bang!)</p>
<p>– Characters breathing in space (Solo and crew): no comments…</p>
<p>– Lack of background of the rest of the galaxy, only fucking Luke: I’ve said enough about this already.</p>
<p>– Ridiculous outfits: specially those turtle helmets and the plastic armor of the storm troopers.</p>
<p>Now, you have to learn that what is old is not necessarily good. Some things are, but not everything. Also, all the old saga was incomplete and full of flaws due to lack of time, money and expertise, and nothing of that happenend to the new saga, made as Lucas intended Star Was to be.</p>
<p> Everything on the new movies is made to fix the old olnes and make everything a whole with sense. They even refused to use CG to make the wookiees, just to avoid creating a big gap between them and that poorly made Chewbacca costume from the old Saga. If something is wrong, is in the old movies, not in the new ones.</p>
<p>Stop loving crap, and start fundamenting your opinions in a more solid way, aside from your own feelings of revolt.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-17470"><p>My Star Wars Prequel Ideas, I just made up right now</p>
<p>Yoda, Obi-Wan, the republic, Stormtroopers/ Republic army and the rest of the Jedi order are fighting a massive galactic war, with a Separatist army that’s rumored to be led by a pair of Sith warriors. Obi-Wan and Yoda are among a group of Jedi trying to find more leads into this mystery, while other Jedi fight the Separatist group. They chase leads on  dangerous, grimy, crime/ Separatist controlled planets looking for leads.</p>
<p>They finally find the Sith Apprentice and a part of the Separatist army on an Urban planet. Obi-Wan and Yoda try to kill him, and discover that the apprentice and his team have been laying the groundwork for a full scale invasion. Yoda and Obi-Wan have to get off the planet to send word to the council. </p>
<p>They search the city for an adequete pilot, scince they don’t have enough credits to buy a new ship, and Yoda forbids stealing one even thogh Obi-Wan suggests it. They hear about a great pilot known as Anakin. They find Anakin who’s supprisingly 15-16 ish. Anakin is street smart, and sly, as well as arrogant. But Yoda senses an extreme potential in the force within Anakin. Yoda and Obi-Wan start training him, hoping he might be a good ally. They have to convince the council to let them do so, given Anakins age. </p>
<p>The chancellor refuses to send support to the system, but is assasinated (assasin made it look like an accident.) Palpatine rises to power and decides to send support to the planet, hoping to gain popularity and even more power through a military win. The planet is liberated from the Separatists but the Sith gets away. Anakin has not reached his potential, but he adapted to the force very rapidly. </p>
<p>Palpatine aka Darth Sidious has a few conversations with his apprentice throughout the movie. This explains Palpatines goal of seizing complete control of the Republic and restoring Sith dominance in the galaxy. He hopes to do so by establishing a fake Separatist/rebel army to create enough tension in the galaxy to expose the undecisive, democratic senate. He will gain his power this way until he has the reigns. While the participants in the rebellion beleive it to be a true revolution, they don’t know it’s true purpose.</p>
<p>That’s the end of number one.</p>

<p>A few years have past, scince Obi-Wan and Yoda met Anakin. Yoda is nearly fully devoted to his time on the council, and can’t go on so many missions anymore. Anakin is now pretty expirienced, and Obi-Wan is no longer a Padawan, and hasn’t been scince Anakin officialy joined the Jedi. Yoda used to be more actively involved in training Anakin but because of Anakins quick ascent through force skills, and Yoda’s increasing council duties, not much is left to teach. Anakin and Obi-Wan work together very often, along with Jedi Ky Muul, and Anya Firdassa (I made them up; Ky Muul is a stoic and honorable Green Nautolan Jedi Master. He’s strong and weilds a double bladed blue lightsaber. Anya is a young, energetic, tough and spunky jedi Knight. She’s agile, and weilds two green lightsabers. She is a tan human.) The team of four is sent to Naboo to finish joining Naboo to the Republics side in the War. When they get there they’re introduced to Padme Amidala, the Queen of Naboo. Anakin and Padme meet after a round of dealings and begin a secret relationship. Anakin and the other Jedi need to secure Naboo’s loyalty by promising protection. Padme becomes the new senator giving up the throne to serve in the galactic Senate. Meanwhile The team of Jedi is sent to track down a lead on the most powerful information broker in the galaxy. The broker has acquired sensitive information that could cause a war between Naboo and another system. The Jedi also find this mission to their advantage, the broker having possible knowlege on the separatists. They eventually find the location of the brokers base, a massive space station. When they get there they reallize that the separatists too are onboard the station and have already begun their assault. To be continued…</p>

<p>Obi-Wan is a man who genuinely loves his teacher and wants to do the right thing. He tries to help people whenever he can, but he’s young, so he can be rash. He goes through a tremendous character arc, growing up after the death of his father figure and raising a child who eventually turns against him.</p>
<p>Qui-Gon loves his student more deeply than really he should. He was mentored by someone who eventually became what he considered “evil” and was thus much more sympathetic to that sort of “evil” person, making Obi-Wan likewise sympathetic. He cared more about people than politics and tried to help people whenever he could, though he retained too much respect for those who had taught him to disobey them in a major way.</p>

It’s never said in the movies, but as I vaguely remember from the books Qui Gon Jinn was a bit of rebel himself and often disagreed with Jedi council. In fact that’s why he wore a long hair (which supposedly is prohibited by the Jedi code or something).</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-19820"><p>I hate to “come out the gate here” being full of vitriol, but after watching the funny and brilliant review for TPM, and then afterwards, reading some of the comments on here about the review itself, I have to say that so many of you miss the point of something like this. Obviously, RedLetterMedia uses comedic themes to create a premise, and that premise runs through all of their material, especially HitB and GameStation 2.0. In these reviews, Mr. Plinkett is executing a style of humor called “satire”. In fact, one might even call it “sardonic”, or “cynical”, or “dry/dark humor”.</p>
<p>The INTENTION of this review (and a lot of other Plinkett reviews) is to insist upon the fact that something as silly as a Star Wars prequel is completely overtaking his mind; and he is driving himself crazy to the point of obsession and rumination over the smallest details of the movie. IMO, there’s a meta-joke hidden in the character of Mr. Plinkett – Mr. Plinkett’s (literally) murderous and defensive standpoint on his own opinion is, ironically, a lot like a stereotypical internet commentator’s might be. With that in mind, the reason why this review ends up being brilliant is because the cynical tone of the review “unintentionally” points out a great deal of plot holes, technical errors, and bad scriptwriting that is present in the movie. </p>
<p>I can say that I’ve always been a fan of Star Wars, especially the OT, so I’m biased as well. Furthermore, it’s implied that Mike S. (Mr. Plinkett) is a fan of the previous movies, because someone who hasn’t seen the OT, or who didn’t appreciate/worship it, wouldn’t dedicate so much time to pointing out the inadequacies in the continuation of such a beloved and hallowed series of films. If you ask me? I personally thought TPM was boring. To me the only “cool” and interesting part of TPM was the lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul, and that’s only because I liked the lightsaber fight scenes in Empire and Jedi so much. I’m biased, yet, we are ALL biased, with us being the imperfect, irrational, carbon-based heliotropes that we are.</p>
<p>This brings me back to my original point – THESE REVIEWS ARE MADE FOR FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT. RLM never takes themselves too seriously, and that’s probably why they’ve garnered so many fans. It’s funny because it’s ABSURD – that is the entire point of comedy. It seems almost impalpable that so many people choose to nitpick a cheeky, silly interpretation of a terrible movie from their own perspective, all while taking themselves too seriously. This “armchair critic” bullshit is like asking for a “Gold Star” from the denizens of the internet. So what’s next? A review of the review of TPM? Or a review of the review of the review of TPM? GImme a fucking break.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the naysayers on this site, and on the internet in general, are just simple, contrary assholes with nothing better to do than to rip on someone who’s doing something funny and original. RedLetterMedia makes hilariously satrical, low-budget-yet-well-conceived internet videos for people and ask for very little in return. That, to me, is a lost art. The art of SUBTLETY.</p>
<p>It seems a lot of you could use a little.</p>

The Plinkett character is an effective device that tells the viewer “even an ignorant psychopath can see what’s wrong with this.” It also helps the writer behind the character to go over the top and/or meaner with his criticism. Aimed at a deserving target and used intelligently, that also seems to work out well.</p>

sensation on Tatooine.   Hot tempered Anakin<br/>
is using his innate capabilities with the force to win, which attracts the attention<br/>
of sith confederates.  Obiwan senses the<br/>
need to take Anakin on as an apprentice to prevent a disaster.   Against the council (which has been<br/>
infiltrated with Sith Lords), Yoda sides with obiwan, and Anakin begins secret<br/>
training.      Obiwan marries Padme (yes, Obiwan).    Anakin rockets to success as a Jedi, until<br/>
his mother dies (something he attributes to Obiwan and the Jedi) and  he falls in love with Padme and eventually<br/>
seduces her.  Obiwan is furious and<br/>
drives off Anakin, who is heartbroken and angry, susceptible to the dark side.    He<br/>
sides with the Sith to take his revenge.   Padme is sent to Dagobah under Yoda’s<br/>
protection when Jedis start dying.   Etc.   Ben<br/>
knows that Luke and Leia are not his children.<br/>
It’s a statement to his character that trains Luke and unites him with Anakin.     BTW- that’s another thing I’d change – I’d<br/>
have Ben Kenobi involved way earlier in looks life since he’s keen on avoiding<br/>
the same disaster he had with Anakin.</p>

<p>The first problem is either you make a fictional almanac or you make a work of drama. Even if Lucas’ writing were competent, plots are all about human interest and pacing — if you set out to tell a story, the audience is going to expect a story, not a recitation of indices. </p>
<p>The second problem is that Lucas’ understanding of his world is and was always nebulous — the prequels feel like recycled fan-fic because it was creative people around him who brought the original Star Wars movies to life by introducing their own interpretations, suggestions and challenges. Lucas was the spark, sure, but his one-man show proved he was nothing more.</p>

After the title crawl, an organian ship bursts onto the screens as it drops out of hyper-space. Immediately you can tell that the ship is in distress as the lights and power flicker on the ship and it is trailing smoke. The two man cockpit shows to pilots, one is franticly pulling up star charts, while the other hitting buttoms to keep the ship operational and asking “Where did we end up?”. The other explains, “We’re about 25 parsecs from our distinition. We’re not going to making it are we.” The other explains, “Without, hyper drive we’re not going anywhere. Find us a place to put down quick, They’re right on our tail.” Then the one looking at the star maps points to a planet. The ship cruises toward the planet. Suddeningly another ship drops out of hyperspace. Its roughly the same size but with different marking and configuration. The crippled ship enters the atmosphere of a desolate desert planet, Tattooine. The ship crashes just outside a city. The pilots abandon the ship grabbing a damaged and inoperable asto-mech droid as they escape to smoldering wreckage. They carry the droid on a gaurney as they head toward the city in the distance.<br/>
The two men try to find an in where they can hide and none of the locals will say anything. Once they secure a place to hide they look for a repair shop to get the droid fixed. Meanwhile the persuing ship lands near the wreckage of the first. Two men in long robes exit the ship and begin investigating the wreckage. Jawas and local people are scavengering about the ship. The two hooded men are a young Obiwan and Mace Windu.<br/>
That’s just a start.<br/>
Essentially, the plot would be that the pilots of the organa ship are sabotuers. The damages droid is R2-D2. One of the men knows the ways of the force. Obiwan and Mace chase the men down and catch up to them, after a long foot chase through the crowded city, with the sabotuers shooting at them and the Jedi deflecting them while trying to protect civilians. (NO Stupid Super Speed Running) They corner the vilians were one pulls out a lightsaber and they duel. But civilians get in the way and the sith endangers them, just at that moment a young man, a street performer, intercedes because his mother and grand-mother are under threat. He uses great acrobatic skills and defeats the Sith. The Jedi are amazed, the force is strong with him, this simple street performer, from poor means a begger using his great powers and skill to support his family, his mother and grandmother. He is Anikin Skywalker. (No Stupid Little Kid) Anakin, knows about the force but his family was always too poor to do anything about it. But Anakin is confused by the evil force user, the Sith. Mace explains that Long ago, before men ever counted the days. there were 2 kinds of people force users and regular people. Some force users were kind and generous, and others were selfish. But they all used the force for personal gains. Later as societies grew, force users were made into kings. Some kings were just others were corrupt. Finally some forcer users studied the force deeply and became priests. They realized that the force was in all things and was meant to be user for the good of all people collectively. But others disagreed, they felt what was the use of having these powers if they couldn’t use them to benefit their own tribe or kingdom or family. There was a great divide and the priests became known as Jedi and others became Sith. Obiwan is confused because their should be no more Sith.<br/>
Anakin joins the Jedis as they travel to Corrisant to report their finding and recover what R2 was carrying. The information he was carrying was from Queen Amadala. It was the notification of a plot on the part of a group of star systems to susseed from the Republic and form a Separatist group. Why, because of their lack of representation in the Senate. These star systems are all corporate, and industrial manufacturing planets. Planets of Commerce and wealth. They want majority representation, But the Republic holds to equal representation. The Seperatists want majority rule inorder to set policies in their favor. To drive down wages and increase their assets. The Separatists are pressuring her star system of Organa (NOT Naboo, No Jar Jar) to join their group or else they’ll sanction here planet and shoot down any ship that leave the system. The Jedi were to rendezvous with the Organain ship in secret, but it was taken over by Separatists  As the pilots were taking the info to their leaders of proof that Amadala had sold them out. Luckily they intercepted the ship and with Anakin’s help they had stopped the bad guys from exposing Amadala testamony about the Separatists. Anakin explains that being from an outlaying planet, these corporate planets use Tattoonie for labor and pay them nothing. These Separatist want to exploit other Star systems the same way. They induct Anakin into the Jedi order and Obiwan is to begin training him. (No Prophecy) Yoda is proud of Obiwan’s progress. Obi is Yoda’s student. They all go Organa to free the Queen and here people from the Separatists pressure and assault.<br/>
They go free the people and the Queen and find that Sith influence is involved with the Separatists. (Nice big battle, No goofy Gungans) Anakin personally rescues Amadala and immediately he puts the moves on her and she likes him too. They share a kiss. (The Jedi are NOT Forbidding to Love or Marry) But if they do marry they are not allowed to have advanced training. That would conflict with their devotions. You can not serve 2 masters.<br/>
In part 2 you could have Obi trying to pressure Anakin to not take his relationship with Amadala too seriously, but Anakin has skill and powers and potiential to get a great Jedi Master. Obi insists that because Anakin is so strong with the force, he owns it to himself to reach his fullest potiential. But Anakin is alreeady falling for Padame and she for him. (Don’t have ANakin be a bad apple from the start. He should be idealistic and smooth and very likable with the ladies.)</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-21834"><p>I have read some of suggestions for a different version of Star Wars prequels. Well here is my suggestion. After the title crawl, an organian ship bursts onto the screens as it drops out of hyper-space. Immediately you can tell that the ship is in distress as the lights and power flicker on the ship and it is trailing smoke. The two man cockpit shows to pilots, one is franticly pulling up star charts, while the other hitting buttoms to keep the ship operational and asking “Where did we end up?”. The other explains, “We’re about 25 parsecs from our destination. We’re not going to making it are we.” The other explains, “Without, hyper drive we’re not going anywhere. Find us a place to put down quick, They’re right on our tail.” Then the one looking at the star maps points to a planet. The ship cruises toward the planet. Suddenly another ship drops out of hyperspace. Its roughly the same size but with different marking and configuration. The crippled ship enters the atmosphere of a desolate desert planet, Tattooine. The ship crashes just outside a city. The pilots abandon the ship grabbing a damaged and inoperable asto-mech droid as they escape to smoldering wreckage. They carry the droid on a gaurney as they head toward the city in the distance.<br/>
The two men try to find an in where they can hide and none of the locals will say anything. Once they secure a place to hide they look for a repair shop to get the droid fixed. Meanwhile the pursuing ship lands near the wreckage of the first. Two men in long robes exit the ship and begin investigating the wreckage. Jawas and local people scavenge about the ship. The two hooded men are a young Obiwan and Mace Windu, maybe Qui-gan.<br/>
That’s just a start.<br/>
Essentially, the plot would be that the pilots of the organa ship are sabotuers. The damages droid is R2-D2. One of the men knows the ways of the force. Obiwan and Mace chase the men down and catch up to them, after a long foot chase through the crowded city, with the sabotuers shooting at them and the Jedi deflecting them while trying to protect civilians. (NO Stupid Super Speed Running) They corner the vilians were one pulls out a lightsaber and they duel. But civilians get in the way and the sith endangers them, just at that moment a young man, a street performer, intercedes because his mother and grand-mother are under threat. He uses great acrobatic skills and defeats the Sith. The Jedi are amazed, the force is strong with him, this simple street performer, from poor means a begger using his great powers and skill to support his family, his mother and grandmother. He is Anikin Skywalker. (No Stupid Little Kid) Anakin, knows about the force but his family was always too poor to do anything about it. But Anakin is confused by the evil force user, the Sith. Mace explains that Long ago, before men ever counted the days. there were 2 kinds of people force users and regular people. Some force users were kind and generous, and others were selfish.

There was a great divide and the priests became known as Jedi and others became Sith. Obiwan is confused because there should be no more Sith.<br/>
Anakin joins the Jedis as they travel to Corrisant to report their finding and recover what R2 was carrying. The information he was carrying was from Queen Amadala. It was the notification of a plot on the part of a group of star systems to succeed from the Republic and form a Separatist group. Why, because of their lack of representation in the Senate. These star systems are all corporate, and industrial manufacturing planets. Planets of Commerce and wealth. They want majority representation, But the Republic holds to equal representation. The Seperatists want majority rule in order to set policies in their favor, to drive down wages and increase their assets. The Separatists are pressuring her star system of Organa (NOT Naboo, No Jar Jar) to join their group, because they are a critical industrial system, they’re using old gangster tactics or pressure and intimidation. No occupying forces just lobbyists and ambassadors of the planet’s they represent following her around and constantly approaching her when she is talking to other representatives to eaves drop on their conversation. They keep trying to reason with her to support them, and that they have the right to form their own coalition. The Jedi were to rendezvous with the Organain ship in secret, but it was taken over by Separatists As the pilots were taking the info to their leaders as proof that Amadala had sold them out. Luckily they intercepted the ship and with Anakin’s help they had stopped the bad guys from exposing Amadala testamony about the Separatists to the Separatists. Anakin explains that being from an outlaying planet, these corporate planets use Tattoonie for labor and pay them nothing. These Separatist want to exploit other Star systems the same way. (NO Boring Senate Meeting) They induct Anakin into the Jedi order and Obiwan is to begin training him. (No Prophecy) Yoda is proud of Obiwan’s progress. Obi is Yoda’s student. They all go Organa, (Obiwan, Mace, maybe Qui-gan, Anakin, and R2) to support the Queen and her people from the Separatists pressure and assault.<br/>
They sneak in to speak to the Queen and find that Sith influence is involved with the Separatists. Then when they confront to Separatists they find that they have a small detachment of about 20 cloned human soldiers with them. (Nice lazer verses saber battle, No goofy Gungans) Anakin personally rescues Amadala from the fighting and immediately he puts the moves on her and she likes him too. They share a kiss. (The Jedi are NOT Forbidding to Love or Marry) But if they do marry they are not allowed to have advanced training. That would conflict with their devotions. You cannot serve 2 masters. </p>
<p>In part 2 you could have Obi trying to pressure Anakin to not take his relationship with Amadala too seriously, but Anakin has skill and powers and potiential to get a great Jedi Master. Obi insists that because Anakin is so strong with the force, he owns it to himself to reach his fullest potiential. But Anakin is already falling for Padame, and she with him. (Don’t have Anakin be a bad apple from the start. He should be idealistic and smooth and very likable with the ladies.)<br/>
Anyway, as Anakin leads Padame away from the fighting they get confronted by another Sith. Anakin has no light-saber. But must use his skill to fight the Sith. Obiwan sees Anakin fighting then joins him in fighting the Sith. Anakin distracts him while Obiwan fight shim. Mace and Qui-gan run to join but are detained by the soldiers. The Sith is almost cornered and disarmed when he take Anakin hostage. Just as Anakin escapes the Sith is able to kill Qui-gan. Then before being disarmed by Obiwan, Mace, and Anakin, who takes up Qui-gan’s saber, the sith commits suicide.<br/>
At the end Organa is placed under the exclusive protection of the Republic’s Space flight guard, to prevent any retaliation by the Separatists. The Republic and the Jedi are worried about the proliferation of Sith knights and the evidence that the Separatists have clone soldiers already, and maybe planning to move against the Republic if they have enough clone soldiers.</p>
<p>Part 2 should open with the Separatist’s first  all out attack on outlaying Star systems and occupying them as they push their way towards the core systems. This attack comes just a month before the supreme chancellor’s re-election. The Chancellor declares a state of emergency and deploys Republic forces to try to retake the occupied systems. One of the occupied systems is Tattoonie.  Anakin has been sending his stipends and allowance to support the family during his early Jedi training.<br/>
Palpatine, Senator of Organa runs for office and criticizes the Chancellor for not acting sooner to reconcile the Separatists or deal with them before this heinous attack. He claims that the Chancellors inaction has led them to war. The Chancellor argues that there may still be time to negotiate with the Separatists; that we need not go to war. But Palpatine argues that we are in a state of war and that we must act now to crush the Separatist movement before it destroys the Republic. Had the chancellor done so earlier, this war would not have engulfed the Republic. The Chancellor disputes that has he acted that way earlier, we would have been plunged into war sooner. War would not have been averted. He argues that Palpatine is war mongering. Plapatine claims that Chancellor is the war monger for threatening the Separatists instead of reconciling them. (Which is what the Chancellor has been doing) Palpatine is using double speak, and has been inciting the Separatists not to reconcile with the Republic and holding off an attack until election time was close.<br/>
Meanwhile Anakin is having meditation lessons with Obiwan. Obiwan explains that when the force is in harmony, it flows like a river, seeping into every corner of existence. Filling all living things up, and where ever the force flows life grows. Obi tells Anakin the force is strong with him because of where he is from. A place that was weak, a place missing life. So the force flowed into him to make life flourish in the desert. The force knows where it is needed. But Yodi interrupts and tells Obi that something is interrupting the flow of the force. Obi agrees they can all feel a disturbance in the force. Something like a great stone is scattering the flow of the force. The force cannot flow freely where it is needed most. The strength of Anakin’s force makes him a good candidate to restore the balance of the force. It seems the force chose him for this. But Anakin is distracted, his mind is on Padame and he worries about his mother under Separatist occupation.</p>

Also your assessment that a story’s basic outline is generic is meaningless. At this point every story is essentially generic at its core. The uniqueness doesnt come from the basic outline. It comes from maybe the setting, the dialogue, or the characters themselves. There are no new stories anymore and there never will be. All thats left is stories with the same basic premises with an interesting twist in one of the things I mentioned.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-22109"><p>It’s because Lucas don’t think of the star wars universe like we do. We perceived it mostly trough games, comic books and the new movies, where the force/training level of the characters matter. But in reality, in the original trilogy your power level didn’t matter so much as the motivation for your character. That’s why they send a vulnerable princess in disguise to jaba’s lair first instead of sending the jedi knight to fuck everyone up and steal Solo’s tablet. I think the new movies should be directed at the new audience, because the old themes from the original trilogy would certainly alienate us more logic and action-craving people and the usual moviegoing nowadays audience. It would be a sure hit. I hope J.J. Abrahams does something like that, but with great streamlined character development and emotion his work is known for.</p>

I agree, the prequels are better in the fact that they explain star wars on a galactic level as opposed to focusing on just a few characters.  Everything makes more sense with the addition of the prequel trilogy and it adds replay value to the old trilogy because you now have an understanding of vader and why he does what he does.  I personally like both trilogies, each for their own reason.</p>

You see RLM has to pay for webspace and junk in order to host videos and whatever. They don’t have like some kinda server farm and a satellite in orbit. And since they know you probably don’t want to pay cash every time you want to watch a video then they make you pay the only other way possible, with thirty seconds of your time, time you can spend not paying attention to the ad anyways. You see, companies pay just have the chance to get your attention.</p>

<p>I stopped reading there because you obviously have no fucking idea what you’re talking about. Almost every engaging movie has a central character we know more about than the other characters in the film. This review explains this. It spends 5 to 10 minutes establishing this point. Are you mental? </p>
<p>Stop using synonyms and spell check to sound smarter than you actually are. It doesn’t help the fact that you are calling everybody here nerds and morons for just being here when YOU are here spending more time trying to defend shit that actually makes no sense to anybody, other than the ‘fanboys’ who convince themselves that it makes sense by breaking it down and reading the books and so on. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-26685"><p>I was just watching Menace again and was struck by Obi-Wan’s illogical reaction to their first encounter with Darth Maul, just before they leave Tatooine. So Obi-Wan was in the ship expecting the return of his master when suddenly the security guy walks in saying “Qui-Gon is in trouble.” Obi-Wan then calmly (already a huge mistake) walks towards the windshield and sees a guy who has come out of nowhere carrying a light saber and attacking Qui-Gon. Later we learn at the Jedi council that the Sith have been extinct for a thousand years, thus neither Obi-Wan nor Qui-Gon have ever seen one. So what should be going through Obi-Wan’s head when he saw the light saber fight? “Who the fuck is that guy? I probably know him because his is obviously a Jedi knight, but why in the hell would he attack Qui-Gon? What was he doing in the middle of the desert to begin with? I must get out there immediately and find out who is this guy!”. But instead he sits at a chair and says: “Take off. Over there, fly low.” This is probably the first time he has ever seen a light saber duel for real, and he is not even slightly impressed by it.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-26742"><p>Another thing about their fight at Tatooine. Why does the probe have to return and report personally to Darth Maul, couldn’t it just send a message? Isn’t the point of having probes to know things without having to actually be there to see them? Why would Darth Maul choose a bike to get to their ship? When he releases the probes it seems he just stands there waiting, so I assume he is close to his ship. The best thing to do would be to get on his ship and blow up the Naboo ship before it takes off, ruining any chances of escape. What if he gets there in the exact moment that they are leaving? He would just stand there in the sand looking stupid, just like he did.<br/>
I know nothing about script writing but I think that if Darth Maul got there in his ship, just moments before they leave tatooine, you could have a quick chase scene before they jump to hyperspace and it would keep the Sith unknown to the Jedi until the fight sequence at Naboo. This would fit well with the council’s choice of sending just two guys back to Naboo, and would add tension to Darth Maul’s revelation at the end.</p>

It was awkward seeing him involved with politics and handing out titles etc. He was much more of an impactful character when he was a fugitive and tossed aside on a dumpy planet. It was a much better way to show how his power didn’t depend on the typical trappings of the world. To see Yoda all mixed up with political intrigue diminished what made him such a memorable character.</p>

So… the MAIN CHARACTER stays behind on the ship on Tatooine and waits while three supporting characters do the entire plot on that planet? Then the MC sits around on Coruscant while the council decides something above his pay-grade and something happens in the Senate and his job is to stand around next to his sensei dude and just look serious. Gee, this is like if Luca Brasi was the main character of the Godfather… thrilling. Obi Wan is a heavy. He is like a bodyguard guy who gets periodically siccced on things. If he actually IS the main character in this movie, that makes it even more lame… if that were possible.</p>

There are insights throughout, but it seems like most of this is just pointing out plot holes. Sure, there’s something to be said for plot holes being able to make a movie worse, but it seems like all the video does is point them out. It never explains “why” plot holes are an issue.</p>
<p>I’m just not sure it’s fair to point at the plot holes as flaws in the movie without explaining why there an issue. I don’t doubt for a second that they ARE in fact an issue in The Phantom Menace, but just pointing them out isn’t really worth doing unless you’re going to explain why you’re pointing them out.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-36929"><p>A point made elsewhere in these reviews:  It’s not necessarily that plot holes take you out of the fun. </p>
<p>The lack of story and character emotionally distances you from the movie, leaving you bored, picking apart the logical flaws and contrived plot devices. </p>
<p>Sloppy plot devices inevitably leave plot holes.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, to a sharp-minded viewer, it all becomes insultingly clear: the filmmaker is a hack, cramming a self-indulgent checklist of all the crap he wants to force into his script. It’s all been contrived.</p>
<p>Flat characters illuminate nothing about life, because hacks care far less for the emotions and lives of his audience than his own cast of cardboard cut-out characters. It’s yet another money grab:  another filmmaker with nothing to say and his characters have nowhere to go and nothing to do.</p>
<p>To those who aren’t dazzled by empty spectacle, who want substance instead of sparklers, there’s nothing behind the theater curtain but a drunken idiot sloppily setting off one bottle rocket after another to the `oohs’ and ‘aahs’ of the witless throng. </p>
<p>Character-driven stories in the classical, 3-act format don’t need chases or heists or explosions to delight and amaze us.</p>
<p>Remember the white-knuckle suspense in the first scene in the recent film ‘Drive’? There was more tension in a few seconds waiting at a stop light than an entire James Bond movie.</p>
<p>In Act 2, a movie tends to bog down.  In Empire Strikes Back, Luke ends up in an actual bog with a wise swamp frog who causes him to face himself before his journey can continue.  One day, we all have to face ourselves… just like Luke does.</p>
<p>As they say in ‘The Three Amigos’, each of us has an El Guapo.  An inner struggle caused by deep but surmountable imperfection.</p>
<p>Like ‘My Fair Lady’ or its variations, we witness a make-over story.  We go from robot-loving nerds to responsible human beings.  The kind of people who would never make a crappy movie like ‘The Phantom Menace’ for the merchandising royalties.</p>
<p>Hell.  Lucas was supposed to be the chosen one. Or something like that.</p>
<p>By working through Luke’s fundamental inner conflicts and facing the shocking “realities” about himself, along with all the natural twists and turns of the story RESULTING from his flaws, we really feel the moments of transformation through struggle, the growing courage and admire the developing inner strength as if it was our own.</p>
<p>In Act 2, nothing needs to blow up. He hides out in a swamp while his buddies hide out in a cave.  Just a boy and a talking frog. </p>
<p>We’re not pulled out of the story.  We suspend our disbelief, forgive any logical contradictions, and we don’t complain when Yoda doesn’t simply offer to lend Luke his egg-shaped space car or send Obi-Wan’s ghost to go call a tow truck for his X-Wing.</p>
<p>Creative, brilliant and rational minds are pulled into the plot holes by unrelenting boredom.  When we’re entertained and enlightened, we don’t give a damn.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-36940"><p>Do you guys know what the greatest joke is? Once you read up on the background of the Trade Federation and all the other background politics and whatnot, the core plot of the movie is actually good. It makes sense in that context.</p>
<p>The problem is, you see NOTHING of that in the movie. You never get to learn why the Trade Federation is a threat, you never get to know why they have armed ships and droid armies, you never learn the political machinations in the background. Nothing!</p>
<p>And no, you don’t need several minutes long exposition in the senate to do that either. Here, let me demonstrate:</p>
<p>*Qui Gon and Obi Wan’s ship gets out of hyperspace and the look upon Naboo and the TF fleet around it*<br/>
Captain: According to the sensors we have three times as much ships as expected. All of them are armed.<br/>
Obi Wan: That’s not an embargo fleet, that is an invasion! What is the Trade Federation doing?<br/>
Qui Gon: What they have been doing in the past few years. They have been using the credits of their corporate allies to lobby in the senate, arm their ships and amass their fleets. Now that money doesn’t do the trick anymore, they try to bully the Republic with brute force.<br/>
Obi Wan: The Republic had grown to complacent in peace.<br/>
Qui Gon: There is no such thing as being too peaceful, but it is true that the Republic doesn’t have the means to defend itself against this aggression.<br/>
*Obi Wan looks over the huge ships as they get ready to dock*<br/>
Obi Wan: I still don’t understand, master. Do they really expect the Republic would give them what they want like this? It makes no sense.<br/>
Qui Gon: No it doesn’t. Not yet. And that worries me.<br/>
Obi Wan: Why?<br/>
Qui Gon: Because that means they have the power to threaten the Republic, the incentive to do so and a plan we know nothing about. It’s the most dangerous combination possible.<br/>
*scene cuts with the hangar doors slowly closing behind the ship*</p>
<p>BAM! Suddenly the Trade Federation sounds like a genuine threat and all it took was two minutes of expository dialog between the two “lead characters” that doesn’t even sound that forced. Contrast this with George’s approach who just threw thousands of droids onto the screen and thought that was enough.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-36975"><p>And again, do you know how easy is that to explain? Interdiction fields! </p>
<p>They are used to create artificial gravity wells and stop ships from escaping an area of engagement by hyperdrive or even pull them out of hyperspace, and the technology have existed for thousands of years at this point (it’s used by Malak in KotOR to intercept the Ebon Hawk at one point). All Lucas had to do was inserting this simple line into any of the dialog either during the very beginning or when they try to escape Naboo the first time:</p>
<p>Qui Gon: The ships orbiting around the equator use interdiction fields to stop any large ships from entering or leaving the system while the fighter droids are patrolling the rest of the space around the planet to hunt down small ships trying to smuggle supplies. However, that also means that they have no fighters around the ships themselves, and those are only armed freighters, so we could break through with a small and fast ship by flying right at them and leave interdiction range before they could scramble more fighters.</p>
<p>BAM, stupid blockade is solved. George Lucas – Random asshat on the internet: 0 – 1</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-36993"><p>Late answer, but relevant: The Trade Federation IS an alliance of the most wealth corporations and planets, the Sith ARE manipulating them (read: Sidious) through their greed to destroy the Republic from within and they want Padme dead because Nute Gunray (the head honcho of the TF) feels offended by her gall to capture him in the first movie. It also explains their name (they are an alliance of the biggest manufacturers, traders and bankers of the galaxy), their droid armies (since they have the backing of several huge manufacturing firms) and their desire to kill Padme in particular. </p>
<p>It’s just that the movies have a narrative that suffers from ADD and refuses to explain anything, instead opting to throw digital shit at the audience and hopes that they forget about the horribly storytelling.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-37078"><p>At one point I actually had a checklist of small things that should have been changed to make the Phantom Menace work. Stuff like:</p>
<p>-Explain the Trade Federation as seen above.<br/>
-Explain that the Naboo queen is actually only a diplomatic figurehead who periodically gets chose from the noble families and stripped from the title at a certain age because of stupid traditions.<br/>
-Make it so that the Trade Federation doesn’t want to kill Qui Gon and Obi wan outright but only bear down on them when they try to snoop around the hangar bay and notice the invasion force.<br/>
-Make Qui Gon very knowledgeable and flexible and make Obi Wan very impulsive with a rigid moral fiber.<br/>
-Keep Jar-Jar, but make him a pained man in exile instead of the silly clown. The funny accent can stay, it works as a juxtaposition.</p>
<p>-Explain the blockade the way I did somewhere around here (in short: the big ships are only there for interdiction-fields, the atmosphere is patrolled by fighter droids and the battleships are only retrofitted cargo haulers so they don’t have the firepower to stop a fast ship with good shields).<br/>
-Drop the bits with R2D2, especially the “thanking the droid” bit. He should be introduced either on Tatooine (they buy him to help with the repairs of the ship) or when they get back to Naboo as one of the fighter astromech droids Anakin bonds with.</p>
<p>-Introduce Darth Maul earlier and give him a simple, straightforward backstory of hating the Jedi and stalk the main group for a while.<br/>
-Make Anakin older, at least fourteen. Also make him less wide-eyed innocent and more jaded (he is a slave, for god’s sake!) and show him to be generally nice but manipulative from the get-go. Also make him want to become a Jedi so that he could get away from Tatooine.</p>
<p>-Drop the “Anakin made C3PO” stupidity. In fact, it would make sense if C3PO was on the queen’s ship (you know, protocol droid?) and he is taken to the planet in case they need translating.<br/>
-Drop the subplot about Qui Gon betting. Instead make Obi Wan do the bets (for money instead of the parts) behind his back and make Qui Gin chastise him for it -&gt; Character development!<br/>
-Keep the midichlorians, but make them into an indicator instead of a means, aka. they are not allowing the use of the Force but are drawn to those strong in the Force. Also, don’t give it a numerical value, instead make Obi Wan say “The boy’s midichlorian count is very high. It’s comparable to Master Yoda’s.” and the Qui Gon respond “Strange. I didn’t feel it in him. He must have great untapped potential.”.</p>
<p>-Make it so that Padme stays on the ship and she only meets Anakin when he shows up to check the ship and see what parts are needed on Watto’s orders.<br/>
-Make the pod-race shorter and without the whole melodrama about the sabotage and whatnot. Just have Anakin use Watto’s pod-racer and barely win, that’s more than enough tension right there.<br/>
-Make it so that they win enough money to either buy both Anakin and Shmi or only Anakin and all the parts needed, and then make Shmi make the decision to stay behind in order to get her son out of there. Make Qui Gon and Obi Wan promise that they would get back to her.</p>
<p>-When Darth Maul first attacks the Jedi as they try to leave, have Qui Gon and Obi Wan be confused as hell and act a little sloppy. This is supposed to be the first time they have seen a Sith in generations and they are in no ways trained in direct saber-duels, so they should only barely escape or even get injured a little.<br/>
-Have two important scenes on the ship: Obi Wan bonding with Anakin, as they are not that far apart in age, and have Obi Wan acknowledge his potential and encourage him that the Jedi council would certainly see it as well. The other scene should be between Padme and Jar-Jar where they both voice their feelings of desperation and worry for their people and that they try to uphold a collected and cheery exterior so that they wouldn’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>-When they get to Coruscant, have multiple scenes detailing Qui Gon looking into the sith in the archives note how Maul seemed to be a skilled fighter yet his saber-technique was unusual and sloppy at times.<br/>
-Have the council refuse to train Anakin on the grounds of age emotional baggage and have Obi Wan protest the decision.<br/>
-When they return to Naboo, have Anakin stove away on the ship because he wants to prove himself. The rest of the scenes kind of work, but with less cutting between them.<br/>
-Have Anakin defy Qui Gon’s order to stay back and instead rush into the battle and get into one of the vacant Naboo fighters, originally planning to use the ship’s cannons to shoot at the droids on the ground, but then R2 gets attached and so Anakin gets the idea to actually follow the formation and fly the thing.</p>
<p>-When Darth Maul shows up, make the jedi have a little “oh crap!” moment, especially when he shows up his double-blader. Have Qui Gon note that it is just as he feared and that it is a type of lightsaber that was designed for duels between Force users, so he tells Obi Wan to make sure their attacks are synchronized so that they can keep him off-balance and won’t have to fight one on one,<br/>
-In space, have Anakin realize that the droid control ship’s shields momentarily shit down around the hangar when it dispatches new fighters and make him use the window of opportunity to fly in, fire all his proton torpedoes. The hit a reactor (just like in the actual movie) that temporarily disables the shields and disrupts the droids, giving the other fighters enough time to bombard the core of the ship and blow it up.<br/>
-In the fight between the two jedi and Maul, have things play out similarly, except at the end Maul separates them and starts sadistically mincing up the limbs of Qui Gon and then impaling him when he is only the ground, enraging Obi Wan. Then have Obi Wan rush in, bashing Maul over and over with his saber like it was a baseball bat, but then Maul starts to play with him as well, injuring his leg. The pain makes Obi Wan momentarily focus, remembering Qui Gon’s note about how the sith’s technique with a single blade was sloppy, and in a sudden spark of inspiration he lunges up, force-pulls the fallen jedi’s saber, and while blocking with his own he uses it to cut the hilt of Maul’s saber in half. Not expecting this, Maul stumbles backwards, and then drops one of the half-sabers, but by that time Obi Wan uses the two blades in his hands to slice him in half while he is too distracted to defend properly, the force-pushes the two halves into the pit with a roar.</p>
<p>-Have the ending play out as in the movie, with the Jadi council grudgingly allowing Obi Wan to train Anakin after he is promoted, and then end with the two of them returning to Tatooine to free Shmi. Once they free her, she says she want to stay behind because all her friends are here, so she says goodbye to Anakin who is already in a robe at this point and promises her that by the next time she sees him, he is going to be the greatest jedi who ever lived, and cue credits while the camera pans up to the twin suns and creating a thematic bridge with Luke leaving his old life behind in New Hope.</p>
<p>BAM, there you go, a tolerable movie right there.</p>

Getting the original Trilogy made was difficult and problematic, the original certainly the most difficult. Lucas was surrounded by industry professionals whose job was to make these productions work, and to add insight, direction and ideas along the way.</p>
<p>Lucas was surrounded by sycophants and yes-men for the Prequels and it shows. He sat on his ass with his coffee and his monitors. The paucity of the result is obvious.</p>

<p>One of Lucasfilm’s many mistakes was in allowing consumers to actually view the production process in the DVD extras. Watching Lucas’ department chiefs repeatedly swap nervous glances while they nod enthusiastically at his every change-of-mind about non-story details, reminds me of nothing less than outtakes from “The Office.”</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-37214"><p>Hey, I’m just working with what I got! If it was depending on me, I would have started the movie at the Naboo capital itself, with the droid armies marching down on the streets. Maybe show a few frightened women and children peeking through windows while the droids mechanically march down the street, there could even be some fires and wrecks littering the streetside, aftermath of the battle, etc.</p>
<p>Then cut to the droid army finally taking the palace, and then have Nute Gunray (possibly accompanied by Darth Maul) capture Padme and then when they get to her, have Qui Gon and Obi Wan rescue her in the nick of time and then they would have to hide out (possibly in the swamp with the gungans). This way there would have been a immediate representation of the power of the droid army, Darth Maul could have proved an adversary for the Jedi from the very beginning, there would have been no Jar-Jar and all the nonsense in the first ten minutes of the movie, etc. etc. etc.<br/>
But then again, that would require rewriting the entire script from the get-go, and as I said somewhere around here, when I wrote up these ideas my main goal was to tweak the already existing content in a way to show how easy it would have been to fix things with just a minimal amount of care.</p>

<p>Or, if you really want them to stay the way they are, make it absolutely clear that it’s Darth Maul who’s actually calling the shots on the ground and that the viceroys are only tools, acting as a front for the sith – maybe even have Maul show some impatience at their incompetence? </p>
<p>Because as things stand in the movie, you have a shadowy figure trying to carry out an overly complicated plan with the worst hench people imaginable, which doesn’t say much for his overall quality as a competent villain. It’s just a pair of idiots getting beaten by another bunch of even bigger idiots. There’s no emotional involvement in taking the Federation down,</p>

I won’t go as far as to suggest it’s worse than the prequels (don’t want to end up in your basement) but god damn! Drink a fucking coffee before recording your voice! I honestly forced myself to watch half of the first part because yes, you make sense and help me learn a lot about storytelling, but your voice sounds like an overworked Wallmart clerk who just wants to finish his shift and ho the hell home! I find your voice utterly painful to listen to, if you can’t get any more energetic even with a shot of amphetamine, ASK SOMEONE TO RECORD IT FOR YOU! When the scene in the basement rolled in I was both bored, tired of listening to you and embarassed by watching how you jar-jar-ly try to shove in several jokes about your basement! Dude, you’re NOT funny. I clicked a link on Cracked hoping it’s an article to read. Was disappointed seeing it’s just videos, but then decided to try and watch it and… Please, put it in an article form, maybe decorated with pictures or videos, beacause the video you’ve put together is just unwatchable!</p>

Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman are talented filmmakers who make informed decisions when expressing their subject matter.<br/>
Presenting your thoughts, even if you barely have an ounce of creativity, should mean considering aesthetics and audience. The mode in which you present content can be as important to your point as what you say, and from this combination the audience derives meaning.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-38554"><p>Okay, I may not have been clear and probably a bit drunk too (for which I apologize). My main point was not that it was unfunny (tho I still think the scene in basement was useless) but that the voice made it really difficult to watch. It felt uninterested and boring regardless of what it was saying.</p>
<p>And, hoping this will let me avoid dealing with people like you, I specifically added the PS. Go ahead and read it. </p>
<p>By the way, second part was much better, maybe because I got used to the voice. But I still upheld what I said before: I absolutely hated the voice and found it hard to focus on the words. That is my opinion and if you have a problem with it, well, your problem. But I do apologize for the way I have expressed it, it was a bit over the top. I was just tired of listening to someone who didn’t seem like he even cared about what was he saying, sounding tired and bored himself and so when it got to the basement scene, I could not hold it anymore.</p>
<p>Again, I was quite drunk and went too far, I apologize, especially since the videos does raise many valid points. I just felt sad it was recorded in a way I found hard to listen. (and was drunk, which was sad too)</p>

<p>No characters in the prequels are nearly as interesting or memorable as the characters in the originals. To me they just seem like people who do and say things the plot needs them to say, rather than people with motivations; that may not actually be the case, but the problem is THAT’S THE WAY IT COMES ACROSS. And that’s what matters.</p>

<p>Jar Jar is a character people hate, but he’s not technically poorly characterized. It’s a bizarre difference, but that’s the conclusion we’re left with when performing this test.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-42006"><p>You’re filling in the gaps yourself–very little of what you describe is on the screen/page. Or it’s just something that happens, without emotional weight. I could say that Qui-Gon loves hot beverages, because he drinks some tea. That doesn’t mean it’s an inherent part of his personality. </p>
<p>“Qui-gon: A stoic, rather serious man”<br/>
Stoic, serious, and other synonyms: actors delivering dialogue in a monotone with blank faces. Not part of a personality.</p>
<p>“who is still a bit of a rebel.”<br/>
You mean he has mild disagreements with the Jedi council?</p>
<p>“He has an innate sense for how people can be helpful”<br/>
He brings characters along who end up being helpful by accident, or for plot convenience. Not the same thing.</p>
<p>“and he’s willing to defy his elders”<br/>
Same thing as rebellious. Using multiple synonyms does not equal a rich personality. Here’s my description of Qui-Gon: blank, vacant, hollow, impassive, lifeless, empty, stiff, deadpan, inexpressive, mask-like, and poker-faced. What a multifaceted character!</p>
<p>“Padme: A girl thrust into a position of power” = her gender and occupation</p>
<p>“before she is prepared for it” = her age </p>
<p>“she tries to be strong for her people”<br/>
Not shown through dialogue or action.</p>
<p>“but inside her heart is breaking”<br/>
Not shown through dialogue or action.</p>
<p>“She enjoys pretending to be a servant”<br/>
Not shown through dialogue or action.</p>
<p>“for the sole reason that she gets to show her emotions”<br/>
I’ll grant you that she is less stiff in her handmaiden costume. But this idea that she can’t show emotions as a queen makes no sense, and isn’t supported by anything in the movie.</p>
<p>“Obi-Wan: A serious practical man”<br/>
Yes, every actor in this movie is “serious.”</p>
<p>“who tends to look at the Force as more of a tool than a source of guidance.”<br/>
I remember zero scenes that indicate this. </p>
<p>“He is not as comfortable with rebellion as his master, and tends to avoid unnecessary risks”<br/>
You mean he has mild disagreements with Qui-Gon?</p>
<p>“Anakin: A boy growing up in a horrible situation”<br/>
His gender. And you avoided the word “slave,” but you’re still talking about his occupation.</p>
<p>“shielded from the bitter reality of his life by his kind master and loving mother.”<br/>
Are you referring to the part where his master yells at him for not working hard enough? Or when Anakin talks about the explosive device in his head?</p>
<p>“He’s a dreamer,”<br/>
I wouldn’t classify “I don’t want to be a slave” as “a dreamer.”</p>
<p>“never satisfied until he’s the best at something”<br/>
He’s already a droid engineer and pod racer at age nine. That implies natural intelligence (or midichlorians). We never see him struggle to become the best at anything. </p>
<p>But he does grow up to become very “serious.”</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-42283"><p>Because videos do not change because you can’t stand them. I would like nearly every gaming review made after 2007 to be reshot with a non-annoying female or a non-faux-radio-voice-douche because apparently G4 has solidified in people’s minds what gamers want in a game review is chirpy annoying girls reading lines with no intelligence behind their eyes or extremely annoying “wacky” radio voices that just sound douchy talking about Nintendo Power tips as if they’re un-Googleable at this point. You either hear Vidya Voodoo organically which is usually made up or wrong, or you get in from a source which may contain spoilers and is less bad ass, doing a combination of both very badly is counter intuitive to gaming culture. Of course I would like this but it’s just not happening because the fans of the Nostalgia Chick website and similar somesuch things don’t care it’s complete crap, it’s being made for them. Crossover episodes of web communities is when it can get really annoying super quick. Watching Alton Brown on whatever lameass “nerd cooking” show he was on is pretty much the epitome of everything I hate in the world, but they will continue to churn on that garbage because people like you just want to see mildly attractive people dressed up like what the kids of a corporate executive would think nerds look like make pop culture references. </p>
<p>The internet is not made for you, you have to make the internet. If you can’t generate content and you hate the content generated, get off the internet. You probably ignored it’s existence for the past 20 years and now you want it to do your bidding now that “work forced you to use it” even though that sounds like “I heard about a thing called internet porno yesterday” to everyone else.</p>

But there is one very short part of the movie I associate with a feeling of awe and that is in the opening scene when we see the half-eaten donut in front of Naboo in a full shot and from slightly above. </p>

It is considered that the protagonist in that poem is Adam, but he doesn’t show up until book 4 (out of 12 books). Up until then, it was just Satan trying to get to Eden, and God’s ridiculously circuitous plan to give Jesus a chance to Sacrifice Himself. And all the events that happen in Genesis is also out of his control. So, I would say that the protagonist doesn’t have to be at the beginning of the story (though he/she should). So, yeah, Anakin is the protagonist in this movie.</p>

There’s someone who meets the Jedi, and thus joins the main plot, very early on, starts out in kind of a bad place in his life, gets to share some backstory as to how he got there, is involved in all the major events of the movie while having a semi-working understanding of what’s at stake and why it’s important, someone who does care about the wellbeing of Naboo but all this jedi/adventuring stuff is new to him — someone who needs things explained to him occasionally, and has the arc of going from a clumsy, out-of-luck outcast to a hero.</p>
<p>The protagonist of Episode One is Jar Jar Binks.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-47063"><p>I agree and it probably at some stage was totally intentional, since Lucas was all about the “seeing the big drama through eyes of a small pawn” stuff. Since C3P0 and R2D2 were just that in previous movies, including them made that intention very very muddy.</p>
<p>That being said, of course, the execution of that idea..well, executed that idea. Just as with other characters, for example the ideally terrifiying enemy who truly represents how powerful and thus seductive the dark side is,, only to show us the tragedy of selfish lust for power – Count Dooku, who I usually forget even is in the third movie.</p>
<p>Mike calls Lucas a simpleton quite often, but what he truly is, is a child. Richie Rich, who got lucky when his imaginative pretend play gripped attention of other children and was then handled by adults (a literal father figure, Lucas teacher Irvin Kershner and others). When nobody opposed him, he just sat in the corner with his action figures, went pew pew pew and people paid millions to watch the sexless preteen idea of a tragedy.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-47234"><p>People criticising these reviews by stating that the original movies also had plot holes have missed the point.</p>
<p>The point is that plot holes can be forgotten, or skimmed over, if the characters and story are engaging enough. When characters are sitting around spouting boring political dialogue that doesn’t make sense; jumping around in perfectly-choregraphed fight scenes; or ‘fighting’ with utterly pointless enemies that present no threat whatsoever – then the tension is removed. If the tension is removed, the problems with the plot come into sharper focus. After that it gets harder and harder to ignore them. Coupled with stupid dialogue, stupid characters and stupid action, the problems compound until it’s just one big mess (yes, I’ve paraphrased Plinkett there).</p>
<p>On a separate note, reading the IMDB message boards it’s become clear to me that ‘plot hole’ is something people say when they mean ‘something I don’t like about the movie’, but want to sound more clever.</p>

I think George intended for Anakin to be the protagonist, but by the point he appears, we’ve lost all interest in any of the characters’ plights.</p>

Darth Maul = Vader before/without the mask and helmet<br/>
Darth Sidious = The Emperor before stardom and fame</p>
<p>What’s worst too is that the name, The Phantom Menace, implies that there’s some sort of Force Ghost menace or something like that. It also makes it look like Lucas is calling the original trilogy some sort of menace, and the fact that its a prequel shows Lucas’ desperation to erase that memory by smearing Darth Maul’s stupid facepaint all over the images of the originals.</p>

Vader tells Tarkin that “he is here”. Tarkin believes that Obi-Wan “surely [he] must be dead by now”. My eyes are rolling. I’m beginning to believe that “They must be dead by now. Destroy what’s left of them” became the work motto for the productions of Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Lucky for us that the real and only Star Wars saga is holy and immortal and its purity being protected by its fans.</p>

<p>So, I was watching <i>Gamesters of Triskelion</i> and I saw another way Episode I fails. In that episode, Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov are enslaved and are forced to wear shock collars to fight as gladiators. Even <i>Star Trek</i>, a show that spent about 30 dollars on wardrobe, handled the whole enslavement thing better than the exploding chip in a multimillion dollar production.</p>

Just because the title has ‘phantom’ or ‘ghost’ in the title doesn’t imply there should be ghosts in the story. The threatening quality i.e. the darkside, can be like a ghost.<br/>
Also Darth Maul is exactly what the Jedi have been expecting, because of what he represents. That’s probably why his face was shown.</p>

<p>He is someone who is at a constant struggle with himself.  He agrees with the principles of his faith and is loyal to it, but also goes against it’s restrictions.  Someone who sees what has to be done and simply does it.  IF there’s consequences later he’ll accept them, but he got the job done.  Kind at heart, empathising with those around him and a guiding father-figure to Obi-wan he is the master you’d come to for advice or help.</p>
<p>For the record the description your video gave of Han Solo was very weak.  He is a great character and they could have came up with more than “scoundrel, good-looking and kind at heart”</p>
<p>I love all the Star Wars movies prequels included as we saw the originals that introduced us to the world and it’s rules, with references to the events of the past.  This meant that essentially there couldn’t be as much drama as we knew how the prequels would play out.  We knew the emperor would take over and form the empire.  You watch the prequels to se just how that unfolds.  As for who is the main character, I’d say Obi-wan.  We don’t experience it through his perspective as it’s more of a third-person movie but Obi-wan has encounters with everyone else and even emotional reactions with them.  As a jedi he doesn’t (can’t) throw out tears, but shows concern out his master defying the council (Ob-wan is a by-the-book Jedi) but also loyalty as he cares deeply for his master (seen in the end when Jinn dies and Obi-wan gets mad and avenges him in what may be the best dual of the series) he is worried about Anakin, trusting the council’s view that he is dangerous but ultimately deciding to train him because it was Jinn’s last request.  This shows an ARC as it’s the first time Obi-Wan has been willing to defy the council (and with the knowledge of the originals we know the mistake that it is to train him and that he’ll be the death of the Jedi) so we are seeing the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>By the way I don’t get the retarded voice in the video (that I hope is an act for the video) and the mispronunciation of protagonist.  </p>
<p>I work in Film/TV as an editor and have my degree in Screen Arts and while i can say your basic formula does suit sic-fi and fantasy best as we need a relatable character to guide us through, it is not essential.  AS long as the rules of the world are clearly established (As they were with the originals/opening titles/opening scene) then we have a context to put these character into.</p>

<p>Obi-wan doesn’t do anything in this movie though. He’s in the background following orders, and that means he can’t be the main character in this story because he isn’t really interacting with other characters; Qui-Gonn does. Qui-Gonn’s the one that makes the plans, makes suggestions, and performs most of the actions-especially when it comes to Anakin-in the movie. Obi-wan does none of these things, and he barely reacts to the world around him because he’s on the ship or driving the submarine or something. There’s also the fact that Qui-Gonn gets the most screen time of any character in the movie.</p>
<p>Now, I get the feeling that Lucas was writing a Sanjuro character. For those who never saw <i>Yojimbo</i> or <i>Sanjuro</i>, this character was a bearded, conniving master swordsman who was secretive about his feelings and helped the weak in a weird and roundabout way. The reason why Sanjuro works, but Qui-Gonn doesn’t is that the use of the term “Knight” implies nobility, honesty, and forthrightedness. This problem is further compounded by the inherent duality of the Star Wars universe where Good and Evil are pretty clearly defined. In contrast, <i>Yojimbo</i> and <i>Sanjuro</i> are a little bit fuzzier on the subject and certainly wasn’t one of the main themes of those movies anyway.</p>

<p>Proving that the only people who enjoy the prequels are mental infants.</p>
<p>“He is someone who is at a constant struggle with himself.”</p>
<p>What?  When?  He just seems to do whatever he wants, with a completely blasé attitude.  If there’s an internal struggle it is at no point shown in the movie.</p>
<p>The only character trait the movie really gives Ginny is that he likes to take the easy way out whenever possible, whether it’s mind-tricking someone into giving him an underwater craft, or using the Force to cheat on a dice roll.  Even when he fights Darth Maul, it comes off not as an act of courage, but as an act of hubris–he doesn’t think he can lose, and if he actually thought for a second he might lose, he’d have probably mind-tricked someone else into fighting for him.<br/>
If anything, Ginny acts more like a Sith than a Jedi, manipulating people and situations to his personal advantage, which BTW would’ve been a much more interesting and subtle character arc than anything in the prequels.</p>

<p>One aspect in which I’d disagree from ‘Plinkett’ is in the idea that these movies have ruined Star Wars. I still like those movies – the original ones – about as much now as I did before the Phantom Menace existed. Actually, I might appreciate them more now then I did then.

You deserve a refund my friend, your time in class was wasted if you think this… things, qualify in anyway as films. You are actually arguing that this movie was better off without a relateable character, and claim that there is some context to this collection of images and sound effects meant to capitalize on more successful stories. Also, you are dead wrong, people didn’t come to the prequels to watch the story unfold. They came for the same reason we went to see the original films, to be entertained and in hopes that the interesting world Lucas created could be expanded. If you just wanted to see how the story unfolded all you needed to do was listen to old Obi Wan in Star Wars and Return of the Jedi. Because like it or not Guest, these movies were not about Obi Wan, they are about Darth Vader. Period. The whole point of these films was to show Vader being created. Everything else is a slapped on plot device to get to Tatooine, pick up Anakin, and make him into Vader. This was a total and complete failure of a film. The following two movies were just as bad. Here’s what I think, you are somewhere around 20 – 25 years old and were a child when these films came out. You were just old enough to be amazed by the lightsabers and blasters and over the next six years you convinced yourself that this was “your generations,” epic films. Star Wars was ground breaking. Empire is the basis by which all sequels would forever be judged. Jedi was okay, but at least tied together the acts of the story. You defend this film because as a child raised in the area of big explosions, lazy writing and rip offs of other films for the sake of name recognition you have no concept of what the made the Star Wars films the hits they were. If you are involved in the editing of anything on TV I sincerely doubt that it is anything more substantive than Jerry Springer or Survivor. Please do the world a favor and never become a movie critic, your input will only hinder, not help. </p>
<p>By the way it’s clear by your comments that you are incapable of understanding humor. As well as being jealous of the originality these guys showed by creating a character like Plinkett. Only children and trolls feel the need to post their resumes in a comment section to “try” and add validity to their point. Well…, children, trolls, and people who only have a casual acquaintanceship with the truth.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-58028"><p>Agreed. Put simply, Obi-wan lacks agency. He’s a subordinate, he followed orders, he took little to no initiative.  I can’t imagine a reasonable argument for him to be the protagonist. </p>
<p>And the idea that Obi-wan had some kind of renegade arc (from by-the-book to defying the council) is undermined by the fact that Obi-wan was an apprentice still in training (thus calling him a “by-the-book jedi” is misleading since he hasn’t finished learning the “book”) and the fact that he participated, without protest, in the force manipulation of Boss Nass at the beginning of the movie, demonstrating that he is ethically lacking from the start.</p>

<p>You see there is a genre called tragedy in which the audience usually knows ahead of time what kind of tragic event is going to occur, but the story is still worth the telling because of how the characters are written and portrayed.  </p>
<p>To see just how that unfolds???  Are the prequels documentaries, I guess they could have been, they were about as exciting as documentaries.  They should have had Werner Hertzog narrate them, The Phantom Menace: The story of how a young film maker was devoured by a flannel bear.</p>

legitimately good points – which you really don’t – otherwise you’d only<br/>
 like an idiot – which you totally do.</p>
<p>“yet darth vader cant land a damn hit on luke” – Luke is protected by the Force, Vader even makes a comment about it…</p>
<p>“1 little lazer can destroy the whole thing?” – Not lasers, torpedoes. One<br/>
tiny spark can create great catastrophies, it’s called a chain reaction.</p>
<p>“heck<br/>
 if i built a death star id for sure cover that damn hole.” – even the<br/>
best architectural structures have flaws. it’s something that was<br/>
clearly overlooked when designed and even then, they were too<br/>
overconfident and never imagined anyone would attempt this sort of<br/>
attack against a seemingly undefeatable battle station. The Death Star<br/>
has defenses adapted to fight off the sort of things that could actually<br/>
 cause damage to it like large capital ships and other. Small fighters<br/>
are like mosquitos to it, who would’ve thought they could be any threat<br/>
at all and the grand scheme of things? It’s only after they assessed the<br/>
 rebels attack that they recognized the flaw in the design and got<br/>
worried to the point of wanting to evacute. They didn’t know about it<br/>
beforehand… And it’s safe to assume the “hole” had some other purpose<br/>
to begin with also…</p>
<p>“what about the fuckin clone troopers their<br/>
 so goddamn stupid” – As opposed to the completely useless and equally<br/>
stupid droids of the prequels? or any opposing army force in any movie<br/>
ever made? If they were realistically competent, the heroes would die in<br/>
 2 seconds and there would be no movie. </p>
<p>“howww are they gonna<br/>
lose the battle at endor against those little creature” – the same way<br/>
the American forces lost in Vietnam.</p>

of the North Vietnamese, and reflected that with the Ewoks. The real<br/>
problem is that America fought the war on the enemy’s terms. Instead of<br/>
targeting the enemy’s infrastructure and bombing the railways, munitions<br/>
 dumps, etc, we just had American soldiers wandering around the forest<br/>
getting ambushed and killed (much like the Stormtroopers). While Lucas<br/>
may believe that victory was due to the Viet Kong’s ingenuity, it was<br/>

I dont think thats how the force works. Plo Koon got taken down while he was flying, and he is strong with the force and it was a damn clone who took him down. The damn torpedos look like slow moving lazers -_-. About the death star, what is this? The twenty first century? Such structures should be extremely formidable and not having direct acces to the core. Sure the other ships are like mosquitos so they didnt worry but if you built such a huge thing protecting the interior is the FIRST thing you do. About the droids, some droids do pose a threat maybe not towards jedi but towards others yea and a lot. The clone troopers in the originals arent a threat to absolutely no one. The guy that made this review is expecting realism from the movie. What if we expected realism from the originals? Than we got a problem, so FUCK THE GUY WHO MADE THE REVIEW. Ultimately this is a matter of when was star wars a part of your childhood, for me the prequels were a part of my childhood. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-122076"><p>The Star Wars prequels were also part of my childhood. I loved the Phantom Menace when I was a kid, and looked forward enormously to Episodes II and III. Seeing the film opened the door to the rest of the rest of the trilogy, and other films in general. I still watch the six movies regularly, and enjoy doing so; but at the same time I find the original trilogy much more involving and compelling. </p>
<p>The use of practical effects and real life sets plays a role in making it feel more real and immediate; but the overall development of the story, characters and dialogue are a much more significant factor. It isn’t so much that they are complex and completely plausible human beings, but that we relate to their motivations. Escaping from one’s own place of origin and overcoming an overwhelming tyrannical force is a recurrent theme in Lucas’s work, visible in the two non-Star Wars features Lucas directed. There are traces of it in the prequels in the character of Anakin Skywalker, but Lucas shot himself in the foot by deliberately invoking a world that isn’t as black and white in its morality. </p>
<p>I have constantly tried to relate to Anakin’s transformation and find it compelling in theory, much less so in execution. His films’s reliance on CGI create vast and pretty landscapes, but don’t have the same dramatic effect, as the use of lighting more this effect is more limited.</p>
<p>It ultimately boils down to one’s own opinions and the arguments they defend them with. A good case could be made in favor of the prequels, as well as a case against the original trilogy (though I haven’t found a wholly convincing one yet). Becoming irate because the Death Star has a vulnerable point or because Luke’s ship is never taken down is nitpicking, and aren’t valid reasons to take down an entire film. They are well known narrative tropes, from the genres that inspired Lucas to write the film in the first place. Of course Luke isn’t going to get shot down, he’s the main character! And unless the Death Star is powered by some sort of perpetual motion machine (which is impossible in practical scientific terms), it needs some sort of fuel to operate.</p>
<p>There are great films that have small inconsistencies, if not outright plot holes. Plinkett does his fair share of nitpicking, and pointing out inconsistencies, but his overall argument is the same that the film doesn’t evoke the same emotional connection that the original films did. If you really like the prequels, this may not change your mind, and I don’t want to. But keep in mind that the point of this kind of analytical exercise, and any review in general, is not to change your opinion, but to exhibit the author’s opinion and hope it encourages further reasonable discussion on a certain topic. So don’t attack the people expressing opinions that you disagree with, and please find a more coherent and courteous way of expressing yourself. Have a nice day.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-59702"><p>Thank you for your reply but you cant deny how awkward the acting was in the originals, especially leia im not saying the prequels had greater acting but they were more serious making me believe it was real scenarios. about cgi or practical effects, cgi is much better. Im just use to modern films at this point. Another point that I hadn’t brought up yet is the light saber dueling, oh boy did I cringe when I saw them in the originals. The best light saber duels are all in episode 3 and portraying the jedi and the sith is imensly important for me.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-59744"><p>I quite literally facepalmed and groaned when you said “cgi or pratical effects, cgi is much better”. This is where you can truly see the immense gap between the older and the newer generation. I then groaned even more when you added “The best light saber duels are all in episode 3″. Clearly, all hope is lost with the new generation… </p>
<p>How is 45 minutes of emotionless and tedious choreographed stunts, pirouettes and sword clashes even qualifiy as a ‘good’ duel is beyond my comprehension. For one, it completely lacks grit due to the cleaness of the choreography, but more importantly, any emotion build up you had leading up to this point evaporated after just the first 30 secs! Stretching the duels out for so long is only overindulgent and completely useless as it only serves to emotionally disconnect you from the characters and the scene.</p>
<p>The duels in the Originals were briefer and worked way better for it. The best example is the Luke and Vader duel at the end of RotJ. Luke gets pissed and just wails on a hapless Vader. There’s no fancy, clean, safe choreography here, just emotion at its purest. Everything is finish within a minute and you got everything you had to understand from the characters from just that.</p>
<p> What point did the duels have in the Prequels, I ask you. What impact did the Qui-gon/Obiwan/Darth Maul duel had on any of the characters? None. The Obiwan/Anakin/Count Dooku duel? Besides someone losing an hand – which even that by itself doesn’t lead up up to anything of significance (quite unlike Luke’s loss of his hand) – even more nothing. The Obiwan/Grievous duel? A brain aneurysm maybe. You’d think the Obiwan/Anakin duel would have some meaning, but no, it’s just as devoided as the others. Now watch the Originals again. A New Hope: Obiwan sacrifies himself and becomes a greater ally to Luke as a result, something that has a lasting effect on the following movies. ESB: Luke is completely outclassed by Vader. He acted brashly when he should’ve heed Yoda’s wisdom and ultimately paid the price. He was no help to his firend and may have in fact endangered them even more by going to Bespin. Harsh lesson learned. RotJ: Luke lashes out at Vader, but after defeating him he realizes he’s becoming like his father (clear parallel between his robotic hand and his father’s). Luke casts away his hate and stands against the Emeror as a Jedi Knight. Oh look, character arc! Something completely absent from the Prequels.</p>
<p>And finally, if you think  light saber duels portray the best aspect of Star Wars, the Force, the Jedi and the Sith than I think quite a few things about the movies went over your head…</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-59746"><p>Aa yes, emotion, the duels in the originals had…… emotions. Hmm are you saying the prequel duels were emotionless? I’m pretty sure they’re not. Qui-gon and obi-wan against maul.  Qui-gon being who he is relies heavily on strong attacks and adapts to a style depending on the needs, nevertheless this makes him predictable and vulnerable. during the Events of episode 1 he was already past his prime. On the other hand  darth maul uses bold, precise and strong attacks. He was sidious’s personal assasin and had trained for years this is why he takes down qui-gon but is unsuccesfull in taking down obi-wan. Because obi-wan knows his limits and is also good in determing the enemys limits. Obi wan was particularly good in blast deflection and also light saber deflection, meaning he has a good defense. After a while he takes down maul when he catches him off guard. Because of this and many other things obi wan becomes one of the greatest duelist during his time, mace-windu spoke highly of him. The fight can be easily viewed as the growth of obi-wan, He is the very same guy that died to vader, the guy you mentioned that sacrificed his life! the death of maul is what makes him grow as a jedi master!… emotions? there are plenty! maybe you must look for them. Similar can be said for the other battles but i wont go into detail.</p>

You must be very confused about the definition of the word “harder,” because an internet post on disqus that has no likes isn’t bashing a thing harder than a 70 minute video that’s been shared all over the internet and gets regular views daily.  I think you should probably go back to the workshop, put a 75 minute video together bashing the original trilogy, posting that on the internet, and then having your video become more popular and relevant than this one.  Once you do that, I think you’ll have succeeded in bashing the original trilogy “harder” than this guy.  Nine poorly written sentences just isn’t going to get it done.  Sorry.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-122103"><p>It’s pretty fundamental. The Original bashers are focusing on technical details such as no CGI, why an exhaust portal, simplistic sabre duels etc. The difference, and the point clearly made in these reviews, is that the Newer movies fail on a fundamental storytelling level.<br/>
Original bashers don’t like the color of the cabinets in the kitchen and hate the dining room light. New bashers are pointing out that the windows leak, there are a few walls missing and the foundation is cracked, built on a slant and is sinking into the mud flats on which the house is built. But damn that’s a beautiful bathroom sink. So shiny!<br/>
Of course you can’t get to the sink because of the three toilets, the electronic toilet paper dispenser, the chrome shaving cream heater, the 17 spangled throw rugs, the eight perfectly formed ionic columns, the low-hanging chandeliers (there are five) and the extended family of Nubian Ibexes living in the bathub.</p>

Even in Star Trek The Undiscovered Country, star ships have emissions.  That waste product has to go somewhere.  In Star Wars they still have garbage chutes and trash compactors on the ship, the technology is fantastic, but familiar at the same time.<br/>
It’s also a metaphor in that something so large and imposing can be destroyed by a smaller ship with a precision strike.  Kind of related to how a small rebel force can lead to the downfall of a massive evil empire, isn’t it?  Those in power become bloated, complacent, arrogant.<br/>
You are comparing tiny, completely irrelevant nitpicks to massive gaping flaws with the shooting, storytelling, writing and acting of the prequels.  It’s just not the same thing, like, at all.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-59943"><p>The acting was far worse in the prequels, and not just from Jake Lloyd.  Every single actor involved in these movies puts in their worst career performance…bar none.  And that is due to the insipid script, and the awful direction of Mr Lucas.  Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Samuel L Jackson….all absolutely top class actors, and all thoroughly terrible in these films.<br/>
CGI vs practical….ugh.  There is great CGI and terrible practical effects, both are just tools like any other.  In these prequels, the CGI is over abundant and not of a realistic standard, even for the time.  Jurassic Park came out 6 years before Phantom Menace, and the CGI in that movie is top class – blends well with the frame, blends seamlessly with the top quality practical effects on display, and adds to the epic scale of that film.<br/>
The CGI in the Prequels looks cartoony, and succeeds in making everything look sterile and fake because the real actors stand out from the frame thanks to the prolific CG.<br/>
The best light sabre duel is actually from Phantom Menace, at least the best on a technical and directing level anyway.  It was actually somewhat exciting (the soundtrack helped immensely) and had the brilliant skills of Ray Park to make it thrilling.  But emotionally the scene was dead, even when Qui Gon died and Obi Wan was supposedly angry.  He looked angry, and then went into the flouncy choreography straight away and there was no emotion to it.  I notice in another comment of yours that you dismiss the motion of the original duels, and that really reveals the difference in audiences nowadays.  They don’t care if it means anything, they just want some whizz-bang effects and loud noises to distract them for 5 minutes.  Action for the sake of it is boring, it has to have meaning or a sense of consequence and believability in order to have any impact or be exciting.  All the flash and CG in the world doesn’t change the fact that the action in the Transformers movies is just not as exciting as anything that happens in the original Die Hard movie.  Just as all the stupid CGI slapstick in the action scenes of the prequels does nothing to even come close to the original attack on the Death Star, despite those effects being so much more primitive.  There’s also more to the Jedi or Sith than their light sabre fights…that you focus on that as “portraying” those characters says all we need to know about how surface level your analysis is and how little you actually know about good film making.</p>

Each blow has some weight to it and you can actually grasp what’s going on and how the duelists are countering and anticipating each other. Not to mention the tactical retreats and re-engagements in the Empire and Jedi fights which served to regulate the rhythm of the scenes and build a little tension from the anticipation of the eventual resumption of the fight. Rather more realistic than the glo-stick waggling in the prequels.</p>
<p>As an aside, this reflects Lucas’ appreciation of Kurosawa films, where the the action was kept basic and kind of visceral to avoid drawing attention away from the characters. poetry, rhymes, vomit, stanzas, etc.</p>

This indicates that they have to have something that powers the main systems, mainly propulsion and the big fucking gun, and that probably requires a lot of reactive fuel.  According to what I read in technical fluff Lucasbooks produced, these are fusion reactors, meaning that they have a technology we have yet to even accomplish.  In essence, what they’ve got in the main reactor (and all the smaller reactors all over this thing that powers everything else) is a very small star.  </p>
<p>Stars produce a lot of heat.  I’d say that a thermal exhaust port is not only necessary, it’s probably essential.  Why shouldn’t it go all the way down to the main reactor?  They didn’t think it would be vulnerable, because, frankly, look what it took to exploit that weakness.  </p>
<p>It took a Force-user going down a trench that went around a spherical object 120km around, flying like a bat-out-of-hell because he was being pursued by enemy fighters, one of which was piloted by another Force-user, firing a shot that, by accounts, seemed particularly difficult even for a computer.  The shaft was ray-shielded (meaning you can’t just shoot blasters down it), so they had to use proton torpedoes (that can make a 70,000g turn).  </p>
<p>I’m sorry.  I guess I just don’t quite understand your problem.</p>

field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us.<br/>
It binds the galaxy together.” – Obi-Wan</p>
<p>“It is said that certain creatures are born with a higher awareness of the<br/>
Force than humans. Their brains are different; they have more<br/>
midi-chlorians in their cells.”<br/>
―George Lucas, establishing guidelines for the Expanded Universe in 1977</p>
<p>I see a direct contradiction – Lucas is claiming that midi-chlorians make people more aware of the force. Ignoring for the moment the fact that all living things are not just pervaded by the Force at all times, but they actually CREATE the force themselves, making it downright silly to think there would be greater or lesser degrees of awareness of something so ubiquitous, the main contradiction in these quotes is that Obi-Wan directly gets his power from the Force. He doesn’t mention the aspect of “awareness” at all, when it’s later stated that such awareness of the force is the only real difference in a Jedi’s ability. </p>
<p>The most offensive thing about midi-chlorians, is that as outlined by Obi-Wan and Yoda, the Force has counterparts in many mystic traditions. “Luminous beings are we! Not this, crude, matter.” </p>
<p>Fuck you Lucas.</p>

The characters and their actions are completely broken in the Prequels; no-one has a clear motivation, or is able to act on a motivation without doing something stupid. Begging for realistic characters is completely justified, and if we do the same with the originals we’d be completely satisfied.<br/>
Yes, you can nit-pick over the minutiae of some of the more sci-fi elements of the original trilogy. The problems discussed in these reviews aren’t just little points about the fantasy; they show the cracks running throughout the entirety of the prequel series.<br/>
Additionally, even if the original trilogy was terrible, how does that justify the awfulness of the Prequels? I know that this review speaks to how they’ve ruined the Star Wars franchise, but if you take that out then all the negatives that lead to that conclusion still stand on their own. Why defend the Prequels by saying that the original trilogy is bad, rather than that the Prequels are good? Even if you’ve got nostalgia for them, you should still be able to realise that they’re awful.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-62167"><p>Hey, I just stumbled over this nice conversation here.</p>
<p>Plus points for us RLM Fans… no one has threatened JM with rape or anything, there might still be some good in us.</p>
<p>Also no one quoted Plinkett, showing him ‘how stupid he is’, but considering his arguments, which is a good think. So I’ll join in to this ‘bottomless comment section':</p>
<p>Bashing the originials is okay, and I even think your points are valid. The exhaust pipe thing was a bit simplistic and was used to wrap up things of enormous proportions pretty quick. Luke didn’t get hit… he just doesn’t… what a lucky guy.. not the only one in movie history. Certainly a lot of lucky Padmes, Anakains, Obi-Wans in the prequel as well.. but nevermind that.</p>
<p>What I rather can support is to defend the prequels. Not every point Plinkett makes is undebatable true. Also, I find nitpicking is a nice thing, which one can apply to every movie, especially your favourite ones. It doesn’t ruin the movie, it just makes you wonder about it again..you don’t forget them.. and that is a good thing(at least with good movies). All in all, Plinkett is right even in his first statement. This movie was sooo dissapointing. I was 22 when I hit the theatres in 1999, and these movies weren’t made for me and my age, perhaps, but I was willing to forgive a lot. I still do.</p>
<p>So, defending the prequels is a very hard job. I would like to see a witty person making a counter review to Plinkett here. (and for the record, saying something like: ‘Well, you don’t like my favourite movies? I think your Star Wars is an asshole, too!’, doesn’t count as witty). So what is there to like? I also don’t think all CG is bad. Naboo looked incredible. I liked the Royal Starship and Darth Mauls ship as an inuendo to later Tie Fighters. I liked the hippie like Jedi Qui Gon Jinn. He became the first Jedi Spirit, and that touches upon some sort of lore I would like to hear more about. Subtlety in contemporary movies is not only lacking, it is processed to camp 4. So I wonder how very subtle this whole thing played out in the prequels: </p>
<p>The Jedi order was flawed, before their extinction. But even though they sort of knew about this, there wasn’t a final statement, like Yoda saying: Oh, it all went to bits, because we haven’t done anything. We must learn more about the force. Like that wicked new spirit thing, Qui Gon recently got into.’ </p>
<p>Why did Yoda have to go into exile, after breaking up the fight against Palpatine? If he did so for becoming wiser and rethink this whole ‘Jedi and the force’ thing, couldn’t they at least say so?</p>
<p>But I wanted to point out good things in the prequel. I don’t mind Jar Jar. He was an idiotic character, for sure, but they got rid of him (mostly) even in Episode 2, and I don’t consider any of these films superior to Episode 1. Jake Lloyd was a Kid in a Star Wars movie. He was flying and shooting and saying some things. I don’t mind him either. I even prefer him to his later incarnation, BECAUSE HE WASN’T EVIL ALL THE TIME. Yes, Lloyds Anakin was a nice helpful boy and introduced us also to this young Padawan thing, which got a dark pay off in the end. Palpatines plan… well that is a biiig nitpick, right there. It is hard to look past the huuuge flaws of this plan and the crazy coincidences that need to happen to make him the Emperor in the end.. but even that I am able to forgive. It is like Luka and Vader in the Death Star Trench… very lucky. I don’t mind inclusion of Jabba or (most of) the other characters since it wasn’t more than a nod. Including C-3PO and Chewbacca was pretty stupid… but at least R2s origin was handled nicely. </p>
<p>Well, I can go on and on, still after all these years. But just a last word for Jonathan Martinez, here: I also don’t hate the Lightsaber Duels of the prequels. They don’t need to be overloaded with emotions. The little emotions the prequel duels conveyed, was enough for me. I at least understood their motivations. BUT since you were going soo into details about every move Darth Maul, Qui Gon and Obi-Wan made during their battle, you might be interested in this video:</p>

Perhaps there are no movies to depict light saber duels well enough, even in the originals, ben kenobi vs vader, it looked like they were fencing at a very slow pace. I picked darth maul vs qui gon and obi wan as an example for emotion and had explained the reason of that battles outcome. The video you sent me demontrates how the director failed in some fight choreagraphy nontheless it was exciting, for me that is. Perhaps I should have focused on the duel in episode 3 anakin vs obi wan. That could have well been the best duel in the entire movie series. In conclusion I like innovation and new ideas. Since many believe the duels were so good in the originals should they have done similar duels in the prequels? I dont think so. Movies have to be made to convince me to think what they’re doing is real. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-63486"><p>I think part of the problem is that Lucas seems to like to think up “set pieces” and then he retrofits a story around them. Somewhere else on the internets there is a transcript with Lucas, Spielberg, and Lawrence Kasdan discussing ideas about Raiders of the Lost Ark. It shows that Lucas was a bit of a mook even back then. It also demonstrates why Empire was so awesome because Kasdan can bring it proper.</p>

Yeah, they meant something as a part of the emotional whole, but there’s so much movement, flashing lights, and obviously (and awkwardly, because of it) choreographed fighting, there’s no room to show their emotions at the time. Lightsabers are also overused here, I don’t remember if he brought that up in this review or his Episode II review.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-63665"><p>One minor note about the “Fear leads to Anger…” part. The largest problem, moreso than the interchangable states, is that little boy Anakin has never really expresses negative emotions. The only thing Jake Lloyd did adequately is be happy-go-lucky the entire movie. The point of that scene is to show us another side to Anakin, but it fails because that scene doesn’t really change him as a person; he doesn’t get angry or cry or anything. Instead,he goes right back to being happy-go-lucky, so it’s not any wonder why we find him so irritating.</p>

I think George Lucas has this idea of something really cool that’s going to happen, and then writes his story to fit that cool thing in. It’s not the worst idea – plenty of writers do the same thing. But when you are trying to incorporate some Byzantine intrigue and labyrinthine plots, it really doesn’t work.</p>

The reason you say he “adequately” portrays happy-go-lucky is because that’s the only thing given to him. You could have had the best child actor out there, and it would have been the same.</p>

Imo the movie should have focus solely on the prophecy concept. The whole idea of Anakin Skywalker being space Jesus could be good if done right of course.

And 2 and 3 seem to me to advance the plots that were left hanging in ep. 1 (except the midichlorian issue I admit). That being said, There were discrepancies of logic in the original Trilogy as well (as far as what they should’ve, could’ve or would’ve done).  Secondly From someone who has never read the peripherals regarding the prequel trilogy, I found Qui Gon to be a passionate Master, who leads with his gut (the opposite of most Jedi) and Queen Amidala Was young but intelligent and wise beyond her years. But with youth comes the Obstacle of being underestimated. But she is someone who would put her duty above all else (at least in the beginning). Third I find that telling a story of a Powerful Order and Republic being uprooted by Villains who don’t have the initial advantage (the opposite of the original trilogy), is harder to do, Thus that explains why they had to set up with extra characters and take three times as long as to get their points a crossed. Fourth I Enjoyed how they used politics to move the story rather than a personal journey. (I’m a huge Game of Thrones fan), And Lastly, The issue of the Battle scenes being 70% choreographed combat and Special Effects, In order to push a movie now days, that is what it takes (case in point the new Star Trek) I don’t mind Pandering to the Main Stream as long as it keeps Our Nerdy Interests alive. (The Hobbit Movies, The Avengers, etc…)</p>

Its an exaggeration of what is perceived as an old recluse and obsessive Star Wars/Star Trek fan that actually makes valid points about the films and filmaking in general. It makes the review more interesting and was part of it’s success. It’s okay if you don’t like (get) the joke just don’t say it’s an “excuse”.</p>

But since Disney decided to act like dick and announce the EU is no longer apart of the 6 original trilogy, the prequel story went from barely ok to being shit again. Now we are once again stuck with the incoherent storytelling that was set in the prequels and Episode 7 story is going to make NO SENSE at all.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-71128"><p>I’m not sure how it’s a compliment that Tolkien used magic to explain much of his world, as that didn’t stop him going into ludicrously detailed mind-numbing explanations that saps all the fun out of the experience. There’s like 3 pages in LOTR devoted to Hobbit lineages for fuck’s sake.</p>
<p>At the heart of the prequels problems is Lucas’ inability to create believable characters with any level of depth. Tolkien has much the same problem, indeed he is even worse, all his characters are just empty vessels for his narration. The only way you ever get any variation to Tolkien’s characters is when they belong to different species. Or are “good” rather than “evil”. The LOTR films are such good adaptations because the pointless tedious elements of the original story were removed &amp; the characters were given actual personalities we could believe in &amp; care about.</p>
<p>Tolkien wrote vast, epic stories &amp; created a world you can immerse yourself in because it is so detailed – so much thought has gone into it. Lucas has done much the same, though. What made either of their stories palatable boils down to the other people involved; people who injected empathy and streamlined the story into something coherent &amp; entertaining.</p>

They’re cannibalising recognisable brand names to make disposible dumbed down, lowest common denominator entertainment for the dumb masses. They’re the cinematic equivalent of a McDonalds hamburger called “the Jedi McBacon” or “the Cheese Bat-Burger”. They’re just exploiting a brand. Nerds like you and I only enter into the equation to the degree that they might squeeze some dollars from our irrational affection for certain characters.</p>
<p>These piece of shit prequels are a perfect example of a horrible, artless product cynically engineered to make money simply on the basis of their brand’s popularity. They don’t even have the base, crude appeal of the Transformer movies. Take away the name “Star Wars” and these things would have bombed at the box office.</p>
<p>But that’s me. I’m a nerd with nerdy interests – I’m a Spider-Man fan, for instance – but I’m not going to like a piece of shit movie (like the first Amazing; I haven’t seen the second) just because, hey, it’s a Spider-Man movie.</p>
<p>Let’s put it this way: our nerd affection is kinda like brand loyalty. And enabling assholes like Lucas is every bit as self-defeating as buying a shit Ford instead of a good, I dunno, a good Toyota just because I’m a “Ford Man”.</p>

Even when Plinkett is not even directly arguing with NC, he’s punching holes in NC’s arguments. NC even indirectly concedes to Plinkett’s points at times. Debate-wise, Plinkett wins.

<p>Really, though, I was hoping that the child who grew up to be Darth Freaking Vader would be darker, mysterious, more of a creepy kid — not full on Wednesday Addams, but definitely less Brian Bonsall from Family Ties.  There are little kids like the one they cast, and then there are rarer kids, ones who are quiet, who stand back and observe, and then come out with things you wouldn’t expect from them; their appeal is not all vested in the twee mispronunciation of words, but on the impression that something is lurking beneath their surface — I went into the film thinking we were getting something along those lines.</p>

<p>EXCUSE ME?</p>
<p>For you to make a statement like that I suspect you haven’t read too much Science Fiction and therefore you take it as given that when you refer to Fantasy/Sci-fi, we understand that you are referring to MOVIES.</p>
<p>There is always the possibility of a small inconsistency in order to move a story along, we are talking about large inconsistencies that strain the limits of credibility and the suspension of disbelief, ones that break you out of the story and have you actively questioning the plot as the story is unfolding.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the prequel trilogy I don’t begrudge you that, however you won’t be able to convince me that the storytelling and respect for the intelligence of the viewer compare to the original. There is some solid content in the prequels but there is also evident lazy writing and general contempt for the viewing audience.</p>

<p>The point of a deflector shield is to prevent the ship from getting hit in the first place, not absorb damage like a health bar.  Most shots would just bounce off, which is why the ship doesn’t get it after its fixed.  Lucky/powerful shots could still break through, which caused the damage in the first place.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-90035"><p>You have to keep in mind that what Plinkett says about lightsaber duels (In this review and all his others) is true for fight scenes in general.  Fight scenes are just that: Scenes.  Their purpose is to advance the plot and develop character.  In the original trilogy, the fight scenes were not only justified but necessary.  Creative choreography can be fun on its own (They Live), but the ultimate point of a fight is to progress the story.  Romeo and Juliet plays in the 1600’s probably didn’t have very convincing swordplay, but obviously that didn’t keep it from becoming one of the most well-known stories in world literature.  </p>
<p>Even in pro wrestling, a medium where a large part of the appeal is in the aesthetics of the simulated violence, there are storylines and things at stake to justify why matches occur.  Sometimes those elements are absent, but even then a (Good) wrestler will captivate the audience with his charisma.  Because of this, fans will become invested in these wrestlers over time and will consistently root for them regardless of the circumstances surrounding their matches.  Going back to film, that just illustrates why it’s important for the audience to actually like and/or care about the people fighting.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-90038"><p>Just to add: In regards to the final duel in Empire, there are a few things Plinkett didn’t quite touch on.  Luke’s first fight with Vader is a David vs. Goliath battle, much like the X-Wings taking on the Death Star in the first movie.  This time it’s different, though, because Luke fails and ends up getting his hand chopped off.  Even though he loses, though, there are still moments in the fight where he surprises Vader with his skill and perseverance (Like when he narrowly escapes being frozen by Force Jumping out of the carbonite chamber).  It’s moments like those that really resonate with an audience.  Underdogs are awesome, and when the odds are really stacked against them, every hit they land can seem significant.  Just think of Rocky managing to floor Apollo Creed in the first round.  Even though that was brief and only served to piss his opponent off, it got the audience’s blood pumping.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen Phantom Menace in maybe ten years, but looking back at the clips I saw there doesn’t seem be that same kind of tension and excitement.  There was so much spinning and flailing that none of their attacks seemed very significant (This is something that Plinkett did mention). Plus, the Darth Maul battle was initially two-on-one, which kind of makes HIM the underdog even if he is a really powerful Sith Lord with a double-lightsaber.  If you made Mike Tyson fight two inferior but accomplished contenders at the same time, you’d probably expect Tyson to lose even if he had horseshoes in his gloves.</p>

<p>There’s also lightsabre physics revolving around how the mechanism by which they work causes them to be extremely unstable in the hands of people who lack the Force. The implication being that Darth Maul kicks so much arse that he can wield a weapon that is more than twice as complicated to use and do so more effectively than two Jedi with simpler weapons.</p>
<p>Yes, I know this is all stuff from encyclopedias and such shite, but that is part of my point. Lucas relied so much on this expanded universe encyclopedia stuff that he says no longer counts to explain away what was his job as the director to tell us.</p>
<p>Ironically, if a director had found a good way to explain to us that lightsabres have a gyroscopic effect and cannot be wielded by just anybody, whilst at the same time explaining how Han was able to cut open a tauntaun with one in spite of that, that would be just competent filmmaking. Good filmmaking if they do it well. The scenes in RoboCop where they are assembling RoboCop whilst his “viewpoint” sees them (“it’s titanium, laminated with kevlar”) are an example of this kind of exposition done like a boss. Lucas has never worked with _anyone_ good enough to do it that well, but even a quarter of the way would have been better than what we got.</p>
<p>Even with a good explanation like that, this would not negate the fact that all three participants in the duel violate the first rule of fencing, and do so repeatedly. That is, never show your opponent your back.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-155808"><p>When I was younger, I had a similar mindset. I would defend TPM zealously, even though I had very little basis from the actual film to defend it with. And the more I began to write stories of my own, write things then pick them apart and put them back together and just try to assemble something that a professional artist would be keen to publish rather than send back and tell me was crap, the more I realised. I realised that everything Plinkett says in this video is spot-on.</p>
<p>Given how long between Return and Phantom Lucas had, it baffles me that he was in such a rush to get a script finished. It reminds me of that statement about videogames. A story is late until it is released, but it sucks forever. Simply delaying the release by a year or two and giving the script to someone who can write a good story would have saved TPM. Above, I wrote in response to a comment by Alex Lee. In my response, I write how one can simply expect an audience to automatically know something. Or worse yet, expect them to read up about it in a canon-guide that a scant fifteen years later you will tell them is invalid. That is what Lucas essentially did here. No explanation other than how you test positive for Jedi is offered concerning the mechanics of the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>That is very, very bad storytelling. Since I used the example of RoboCop above, I will repeat it here. In five minutes flat, Paul and Ed explained everything that the audience needed to know in order to not only have it make sense, but for it to be one of the most awesome times one can have passively watching images.</p>
<p>TPM, by comparison, gives us “oh, let me administer this blood test, hey congratulations you are a Jedi”, and nothing else. Even when the fans might want it. We see nothing of how Jedi are trained under optimal circumstances, how lightsabres work, or even what makes a person want to become a Jedi. In fact that last one is a really sore point.</p>
<p>You see, all that the prequels have succeeded in is making the people who were supposed to be good guys in the other three films look like assholes that nobody in their right mind would want to be.</p>
<p>In the prequels, Jedi are people that I would cut down with my lightsabre if I caught them anywhere near my nephew or nieces. And that is all thanks to George Lucas’ exquisitely bad storytelling.</p>
<p>In other Plinkett reviews, he says “let’s stop and think about this for a second” or words to that effect at least once. I would urge you to do the same.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-155885"><p>Thomas: I would like to wrap your comments up in a bow and send them to one poster just above you on this page.</p>
<p>I just wanted to chuck in my pennies about a couple of things you write.</p>
<p>I think the same effect, the who-cares-what-is-happening effect, occurs in Peter Jackson’s Middle Earth In Name Only films. I was watching a lot of the making-ofs around the time that the home video releases were occurring, and one thing I could not get past no matter how I tried was all of the bragging about how these big battle sequences were 50+ minutes long and had thousands of characters involved. When I was looking over the finished product, many things came to mind.</p>
<p>One, he was lying when he said characters. There’s maybe one or two characters in each film that the audience is given enough reason to care about, and the rest of the battle is basically anonymous figures in a computer killing each other in videogame ways. Second, and this is what I wanted to touch on in terms of the Empire duel, the story does not progress one iota whilst these protracted battle sequences take place. It is as if the story stops dead while Good Stereotype Guys murder the shit out of Bad Stereotype Guys.</p>
<p>Empire achieves something that I have only seen duplicated in one other film that I can remember, 13 Assassins. As the duel and escape-fight progresses, you learn new things about the characters. You learn that there IS a point that pushing Lando past will get him to turn on you even when you have him by the proverbials. You learn that Leia really IS in love with Han. And most importantly, you learn that Luke and Vader are not just play-fencing like children.</p>
<p>At the start of that duel, I could not help but think Vader must be thinking “if I did not need this suit just to exist, I would hand this boy his arse in no time”. Then as Luke uses the Force to escape traps, Vader adjusts his strategy around the fact that Luke might not be completely incompetent after all. The moments when Vader is using the Force to throw stuff at Luke, battering him, are all about softening Luke up for taking to the Emperor. But the real fusion of storytelling with visual excitement is that quick moment where Luke hits a hit into Vader that makes him say ouch, then quickly retaliates by cutting Luke’s hand off. We see that had Luke exercised some patience and not given in to the visions of his friends being tortured, the outcome of the fight might have been very different. He learned enough along the way to at least remind Vader that Vader is not invulnerable.</p>
<p>I will be brief about Jedi. That score music where we hear the baritone men wordlessly hum tells more story than anything going on in the other two segments of the battle put together. It tells the audience “oh no! everything the last few Jedi have been striving for for the past five or six hours is gone, maybe forever”. It is the Star Wars equivalent of the moment in RoboCop where RoboCop is angrily striding out of his rest chamber with science men vainly urging him to stop.</p>
<p>Call me what you like, but I actually enjoyed Jedi (slightly) more than any other SW film for that part alone.</p>
<p>But the point of all that is that it proves Plinkett is right about the duels. They are not about fighting but rather the story that leads into them. And the story that leads into the TPM duels is CRAP, no it’s SHIT… <img alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://redlettermedia.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/></p>
<p>I do, however, disagree about the Darth Maul duel, up to a point. There are underdogs and underdogs. And again, this is part of what Plinkett is talking about in his review about the story versus choreography. Yes, I know saying “the novel says…” is boneheaded, but hear me out. The text about the duel talks about how Maul is always in control, how after this amount of time the Jedi are no closer to winning, and so forth. But because we are given no basis on which to understand how elite Maul is supposed to be, we cannot understand things like that from the film.</p>
<p>What I would have done is have a few scenes in the film where Jedi are being killed in groups and nobody knows who is doing it until Maul pops out of nowhere on Tattooine and tries to take down Qui-Gon. A quick moment where five Jedi are coming to the aid of some unrelated person, and Maul kills them all. Anything like that. But Lucas is and was such an idiot that he thinks he can just have one actor with no character development whatever do flips and kicks and swing a two-bladed sabre and audiences will automatically twig that the Jedi are coming from a place of weakness in this battle.</p>
<p>It is kind of like how they do it in the real X-Men films. They make it painfully clear that the normies have all the weapons, control of society, etc etc, so the only thing saving the Mutants from doom is their powers. A good director like Bryan Singer or Matthew Vaughn knows you do not take it for granted that an audience knows or understands things like that. Hell, a vaguely competent directly knows not to take it for granted.</p>
<p>So I submit to you that in the hands of a good director, the audience would have known that Darth Maul is the Force equivalent of Bruce Lee, and Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan are the equivalent of newly-minted black belts. In that context, the audience should have been surprised that Qui-Gon lasted for as long as he did.</p>
<p>Everyone can chew me out at their leisure for saying it, but the things Lucas _did not_ explicitly spell out on the screen such as Maul’s true ability or the operational physics of lightsabres are what seals him as an incompetent dickhead, not what he _did_ put on the screen.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-157923"><p>There is also a funny little detail that Lucas invalidated with his “EU is not canon” edict that says lightsabres cosmetically relate to personal history. If you look at Qui-Gon’s, older Obi-Wan’s, and Luke’s ROTJ lightsabres, you notice they have a lot in common. (The same is true of Anakin’s/Vader’s lightsabres next to Yoda’s.)</p>
<p>But I digress. I am probably the only person who took any notice of that whilst watching TPM (or any prequel) at the premieres. The fact that I took notice of it during these duels says a lot about me AND the duels. Heh.</p>
<p>Probably the moment that came off the worst for me in the Naboo duel, however, was when Maul awkwardly balances himself on the edge of a platform, blocks both of his opponents at once, then backflips onto a path that has got to be at least a long-jump record away from him. I mean, the other shots in the duel, I can sort of at least understand as having some form of purpose or progression within the fight. But that one… why did anyone bother?</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-289872"><p>I agree with most of what you wrote here and think you did a good job in making your arguments. I do disagree with your final argument in a small way.</p>
<p>The reason why the duel in Empire works is because we know that Vader is a powerful and corrupt character and that Luke is essentially an up-and-comer. They never made this statement in the movie, yet the audience knows this without it being spelled out. Vader uses the force to choke a commanding officer to death in front of another officer… while he’s promoting him to the position of the man who’s literally dying next to him. This wasn’t for laughs, this was to drive home what the stakes are and who Vader is, his power and willingness to utilize it. </p>
<p>This also informs the audience that he’s in control now, and there’s no Grand Moff Tarkin to pull the leash on him. And we’re reminded of this when another commander loses track of the Falcon, goes to apologist and is killed for his efforts. </p>
<p>When you see Luke struggle to maintain control over the objects he’s levitating while his mind is flooded with images of his friends enduring a lot of pain, we know that he’s not as powerful as Vader and the audience wonders how he’s going to overcome this challenge.</p>
<p>In the Phantom Menance, in order for the fight scene in the end to matter, I would have shown the Jedi’s sparring with each other. Jin dueling another Jedi who’s clearly better and is a step faster. Kenobi’s sparring with a fourth Jedi and is dispatched even faster. They don’t even need to say anything cute like, “You’re training him? Your student is in trouble.” Later these two Jedi’s (shown in additional scenes as the plot progresses and is shown to be the prefered pairing to send on missions) are attacked and defeated by Darth Horn Head.</p>
<p>You don’t need to spell it out, but you do have to show the audience that Horn Head is proficient in defeating multiple adversaries simultaneously.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more detail that can be added here (like showing Kenobi’s youth and energy by wanting to continue sparring while Jin stops him from over-excreting himself… showing the other two Jedi accomplishing something else between the spars and their deaths to reinforce the idea that their victories were not flukes), but in order to save The Phantom Menace, you pretty much need to rip the entire story into shreds and start over as if it didn’t exist.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-303447"><p>You know, another way they could have saved the mom occurred to me recently–so Qui-Gon booze puts up Anakin’s pod-racer against Anakin’s freedom (well he influences the die roll to make it Anakin’s freedom).  But in a bet, ordinarily (and in this case) winner takes all–so they actually still HAD the pod AND Anakin’s freedom.  In fact, there’s even a scene where Anakin runs to his mom all excited like “look at all the money we got from selling the pod,” which begs the question–why couldn’t they have bough her with THAT money, or by trading the pod?  Watto seemed willing to trade a pod for a SINGE slave–being recently destitute probably only would make him more willing to take a big sack of cash for Shmi, who, again, serves what purpose to Watto exactly?  Cleaning her own dishes, as Mr. Plinkett would say? XD</p>
<p>If it’s not quite enough, would “the queen’s wardrobe,” mentioned as another item of value in their possession earlier, have been enough to make up the difference?  Oh, but then the queen wouldn’t have been able to dress in so many RIVETING costumes.  Oh, but then if that had worked, Anakin wouldn’t have been able to have visions of his mother being kidnapped and raped by sand people, and then murdered a whole village of them, and then gone on a megalomaniacal rant…oh…</p>

<p>Jim Raynor (the online name of the guy who wrote the 108 page response) makes a few valid points, I actually agree with him that Qui Gon Jin is a slightly stronger character that what RLM gives him credit for, and I can see what Lucas was going for with him. But many of his arguments are…stretching it shall we say (especially when he tries to defend Padmé’s character). Raynor glosses over the fact that Qui-Gon really doesn’t have any a.) emotional arc, b.) personal development of any kind and c.) any actual stake in the plot. He’s nowhere near strong enough to carry the movie by himself, and he dies at the end anyway and is only mentioned a few times in passing. </p>
<p>In many other cases Raynor evades or misrepresent’s RLM’s points. Consider the following paragrah:</p>
<p>“4:40 Plinkett: “So the Trade Federation have set up a blockade around<br/>
 Naboo, in order to stop them from getting space supplies. Which<br/>
instantly causes some kind of crisis, that we never see [screech<br/>
stop]…OK, I don’t get it.”<br/>
One praise for the RLM review that I’ve seen on various message boards is how well- edited the video is. However, these editing tricks are annoying and embarrassing when used to draw attention to points that are just plain stupid and wrong. Here’s an example of it. Stoklasa  screeches the sound to a stop as if he’s making some kind of clever  point here, when in fact he’s not. Seriously, he doesn’t seem to understand why a blockade would cause a  crisis, and asks what that crisis is as if there’s some kind of story  that needs to be told about it. This is simply unbelievable. A blockade  shuts down trade, as he points out. That obviously hurts a society, and at the very least a military blockade is a violation of their  sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Raynor here is evading RLM’s main point, is that we never actually see the effects of the Trade Federation’s actions on Naboo, despite them being an important driving element of the plot. We constantly hear how Padmé’s “people are dying” and how the situation is so dire on Naboo, but we never see any of this at all. In fact we never see a single Naboo citizen at all except a few pilots and officials. This aspect of the movie could and should have been handled better, but in the end it turned into such a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Also, the ‘rebuttal’ is filled with excessive nitpicking (which is something Raynor accuses RLM of doing), and a rather nasty amount of ad-hominem attacks. This is notable because later Raynor complains about RLM employing “smear tactics” and “character assasination” against Lucas.</p>

<p>I might just take you up on that offer when I become a movie director. Also, I was merely pointing out the irony in your comment, not so much that you spelled the word incorrectly. It make sense that if you’re going to have the galls to call others retarded, you should at  <i>least</i> get the word correct.</p>

The only time I can remember them not being present is Luke’s confrontation with the Emperor in Jedi. The point is they always follow the action.</p>
<p>This is where The Phantom Menace completely fucked up, by not having us start with the two droids (“it’s like poetry, it’s sort of they rhyme”). We should have seen C3PO and R2D2 being servants for the Queen of Naboo or whatever when the Droid army attacks, making us actually give a shit about the people being invaded. Whereas in Star Wars Princess Leia is captured, Queen Amidala could’ve been rescued by the suddenly appearing Jedi, showing us how Jedi acted as the “guardians of peace and justice in the old republic”. </p>
<p>Sadly no, instead we have to sit through an hour of Jedi talking in a boring space station, meeting boring villains, then flying down to the planet and meeting a cartoon rabbit and…..God it’s just so stupid.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-356603"><p>There’s just so much wrong with this movie that it’s impossible to cover all of it, even in a 70 min. review. You can talk about all the major things, but then when you get right down to it even seemingly minor issues turn out to have major implications. Take the bongo (?) ride through the planet core, for example. I get that in science fantasy like Star Wars you have to suspend your disbelief a little, but like Plinkett says in the Episode II review you can’t stretch the rules of reality too far or it becomes ridiculous. </p>
<p>First of all, to get down far enough to even reach the planet’s crust at the bottom of the ocean the bongo would have to be able to withstand enormous amounts of pressure, as would the people inside of it. Next, you have the issue of not only having to dig a tunnel through the center of the planet in order to make this kind of travel possible, but actually then traveling through it. This only works if the entire planet has no molten layers or a core that is extremely hot and extremely pressurized. So you could argue that Naboo is an entirely cool, solid chunk of rock, except for the fact that a hot core is actually necessary to maintain a magnet field around the planet and support life. Considering again the fact that it also makes no sense for the droid army to even land on the other side of the planet from their target, you’d think that if Lucas was really dead-set on them meeting the Gungans and taking a secret underwater craft to get to the city, he’d just have the underwater city be off the coast of Theed or something. </p>
<p>And besides all that science stuff, why would the Gungans have this planet core passage that leads directly to Theed anyway, since they don’t exactly seem to get along with the humans on the planet very well? Why would they even want or need that? My only guess is that they wanted to connect with another Gungan settlement on the other side of the planet, but we never see or hear about one. I don’t know, this is a film for babies, so maybe it’s supposed to appeal to the kid in all of us who thought they’d end up in China if they dug a hole deep enough in the backyard or something.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-356604"><p>My guess is that hand motions just make it easier, you’d probably have to concentrate a lot harder to move things with your mind without it. Even in the originals we see it done both ways; Luke is able to levitate C-3PO while his hands are tied, but we also see Yoda using his hand when lifting the X-wing out of the swamp, and Vader almost always holds out his hand when doing a force-choke. Also, the little hand waves serve as an easy visual clue to the audience that the Force is being used, plus I think it was also a callback to the handwave Obi-Wan did when he used the mind trick in A New Hope.</p>

The shots would’ve been deflected, true, but ultimately the shield still does nothing because right after it’s fixed they fly away without being attacked again, which dissolves all the tension in the scene.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-358823"><p>You “can’t imagine a reasonable argument for him to be the protagonist” because you’re only imagining the character from the way he appears in the final film.  In the original draft of TPM, most of Qui-Gon’s actions were transferred to Obi-Wan.  Obi was the only Jedi sent to deal with the blockade at the beginning and the story followed him to Naboo, Gungan City, Planet Core, Thebes, Tatooine all the way to Coruscant where Qui-Gon finally enters the picture.  From then on, Qui-Gon’s role is similar to the finished film.  </p>
<p>In almost all references to the prequel trilogy pre-1995, George stated the prequel trilogy would basically follow the story of Obi-Wan (which it largely does) and Anakin….he even said this before he decided to make Anakin and Darth Vader the same person.  Obi-Wan is a main character in not only the entire saga, but specifically the prequels so it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give the principle action to Obi-Wan than a throwaway character who exists purely to die.  He should’ve trusted his first instincts there, but I guess he wanted us to feel some real stakes when Qui-Gon died so he needed more screen time.</p>
<p>I’m guessing you grew up with the prequels and if that’s the case, I can see where it would be hard to imagine a world where Obi-Wan’s character might have been represented differently than it was in the prequel trilogy.  If not, I’m surprised you can’t imagine how it all could’ve been written differently.  Remember there was a time when the Star Wars backstory was a mere outline, largely undeveloped and the character could’ve been written differently.  GL certainly started with the idea of making Obi-Wan an established Jedi Knight rather than a padawan.  The opening scroll even calls Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight so apparently GL forgot to amend it after switching the action to Obi-Wan.  Despite his numerous attempts at reinforcing the facade that he had the entire story planned from the beginning, in reality Lucas was just making it all up as he went along.</p>
<p>Sure the way it turned out, the character is subordinate to Qui-Gon and less suited to be the protagonist, but it didn’t have to be that way.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-360540"><p>You know something else funny I just noticed? When the Jedi were sneaking around Theed they could have just snuck up on the Viceroy, destroyed the few droids around them and capture him, essentially solving the problem then and there by taking out the leadership and/or forcing negotiations as was there entire purpose for being there in the first place. </p>
<p>You could essentially cut out the entire rest of the movie, have the jedi free Amidala if you really want, then instead of fighting into the friggin’ hangar, instead go for the Viceroy! He’s right there, in the palace, and he doesn’t know you’re coming! I mean, what possible reason would you have to not just free some captured people for reinforcements or just get the Viceroy while he’s exposed!</p>
<p>Honestly, if I had to edit this film and try and salvage it, I would change the entire order of things – Have the Federation invade Naboo, this cause trouble in the senate, which started vote of no confidence and then the Jedi are sent to clean up the mess the senate couldn’t under the disguise of negotiating.<br/>
…<br/>
I’d maybe have Tatooine maybe be the opening sequence, a mission that Obi Wan and Qui Gon are on when they get summoned by the senate/jedi (because Tatooine is close to Naboo as established in Ep. 2). Then the Coruscant debate where they here the message from the governor (about the death toll) which leads to the vote of no confidence, I’d have Padme be the handmaid/senatorial aide the whole time (who will then later become senator herself) and finally I’d mash-up the start of the film with the end, to have the Jedi arrive supposedly to negotiate, the trade federation would hear from Sidious<br/>
 about their true motives, (like an anonymous tip off or something,) and<br/>
then they’d be forced to sneak onto Naboo and somehow capture the<br/>
Viceroy by freeing people and killing useless robots.<br/>
Make the whole thing 90 minutes tops.<br/>
…<br/>
Fuck it, I’m gonna try and do that now.</p>
