<p>JD Salinger wrote <em>The Catcher In The Rye </em>in 1951. It was originally published for adults but its themes of teenage angst and alienation saw it gain a new audience with adolescent readers. Written in a subjective style from the point of view of its protagonist and antihero Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought process. Holden Caulfield has since become an icon for teenage rebellion. Between 1961 and 1982, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States. But it was also the second most taught book in American schools. In 2005, the novel was included on <em>Time Magazine's</em> list of the 100 best English language novels written since 1923.</p><div class="inline-content photo full">

<p class="comment">I have to protest at the recorded promotion for this programme, in which Michael Cathcart refers to the novel as "Catcher in the Rye". Henry James didn't write "Ambassadors"; he wrote "The Ambassadors". Charles Dickens didn't write "Christmas Carol"; he wrote "A Christmas Carol". David Malouf didn't write "Great World"; he wrote "The Great World". And JD Salinger didn't write "Catcher in the Rye"; he wrote "The Catcher in the Rye", as the dustwrapper you've used as an illustration shows clearly. Definite and indefinite articles in book titles are important, and their omission can completely change the meaning of a title or render it absurd.<br/>And you might want to remove the errant apostrophe from your description of the programme - "...it's themes of teenage angst and alienation...".  <br/></p>

<p class="comment">My absolute favourite of the American classics; in fact I've just finished reading it for the 14th time. Sad and tragic but true. My first reading was about age 17 and last was at age 63 and every reading was different - it could be a maturing thing or a current state of mind, but whatever, it is a gorgeous book with so many facets. I think for ages about how beautifully his words were place one after another.  Every word is delicious and has there ever been a character so beautifully and lovingly drawn? Of course, Holden would think we're a mob of wankers for even taking the time to discuss his miserable and aimless life, and if we were sitting in some bar sipping martinis with the jazz playing in the background, it would really top things off.  I love that old JD put this piece together then skulked off and pulled down the blinds. (His other couple of stories didn't do it for me.)  In case you're interested, my absolute favourite word in the book just has to be 'grools&amp;amp;quot; -describing the three girls in the bar who spurned him but were happy for him to pick up the tab for the drinks. In today's world of 'must know everything' isn't it just great that here is one of the all-time best writers and he will always remain a mystery? <br/>If ever you wanted to entice a young person to read, just chuck this on his/her bed. <br/> <br/></p>

<p class="comment">I agree with Tony M: use English, not Manglish, or Malbornish. Having had to read The Catcher in the Rye in High School, back in the ' 60s, I can only say: what a boringly stupid load of rubbish. The only other book to come near is The Old Man &amp; the Sea, with its weird &amp; unfathomable punch line about " Eshark", which is neither English nor Spanish, or anything else. Has no one noticed?</p>

<p class="comment">I agree, I read it as a teenager and only finished the silly novel because it was required reading. It was rugbish elevated to some sort of cult status by curriculum writers supposedly because it 'spoke to the youth of today'. I was and remain widely read and eclectic but this was a book that murdered trees for no good purpose.</p>

<p class="comment">Hi 'Aptitude'.....!<br/><br/>Sorry you found  'The Catcher...' a 'boringly stupid load of rubbish'. I guess it's the adage of 'each to his/her own.' But Goddamn, it still kills me that you're missing so much.<br/><br/>However, let me help you with handling Hemingway. I'll try to take you through this slowly.<br/><br/> At the end of the novel, with the old man, 'defeated but not destroyed', back at the fishing village after 'catching'(!) the giant marlin, tourists spot its skeleton in the harbour. They ask a waiter at the harbour-side bar about it. The man tries to clarify what has happened, knowing that sharks have ripped the old man's fish to pieces. <br/><br/>A 'tiburon' (shark) has left only the beautiful skeleton and tail of the marlin to float in the harbour rubbish, he tells them.<br/><br/>Sadly but typically, the tourists  don't comprehend; the waiter then tries to make the facts clearer in - if you like - 'Manglish', saying 'Eshark'. <br/><br/>They still don't get it....<br/><br/>And yes - to answer your last query -quite a few have 'noticed'!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/><br/>Cassandra</p>

<p class="comment">I only recently read The Catcher In The Rye, and the question which leapt off every page for me was what sort of father would engender such a jaundiced dysfunctional youth as Holden Caulfield. Holden's neatly described behaviour and attitudes all seemed to me to show him just helplessly emulating his father and unable to find himself.<br/>The tantalising expectation which was almost fulfilled near the end of the book was that we would eventually meet the man whose neglect and undertone of abuse was responsible for Caulfield's psychopathy. But alas, it didn’t happen, we were just left to speculate on what an unpleasant and revealing encounter it would have been.<br/>In other words, I think this novel is a prophetic parable describing the degeneration of the 'American Dream' which the father embodied and which Holden was reluctantly adopting, as a result of not having the spiritual and mental resilience to resist.</p>

<p class="comment">I have not read Catcher in decades, although I did read it more than once when in my late teens. The scene that resonated and has always stayed with me was when Holden got into the family home and woke his sister. Pheobe is the sage voice in this book, and all the more important because she is a child. When Holden explains his dream or vision, saving the children from the precipice they cannot see from within the field of rye - surely the most exceptional of adolescent visions, intentions and hopes in the history of modern fiction -  Pheobe succinctly puts her brothers's fantasy into real-life terms: 'Daddy's gonna kill you...'</p>

<p class="comment">I remember the fact that we studied The Catcher In The Rye when I was in Year 9 or Year 10 at high school in the 1970s, but not much else about the book, apart from that.   <br/>The only clear memory that I have from the book is where Holden Caulfield was trying to break into a house.  He unrolls a sheet of plastic which is sticky (adhesive) on one side - like what we would describe today as "contact". He places it over a window, completely covering the window glass pane, then he hits the glass and breaks the window. Instead of shattering into thousands of pieces, most of the glass stays glued to the sheet of adhesive plastic, so he lifts the sheet out of the way, then climbs through the window opening without cutting himself on broken glass. <br/>I have forgotten almost everything else about the book, but that one bit of practical information has stayed with me since then, and I have often used it when I have needed to break windows or other sheets of glass in a safe (and non-criminal) manner. <br/>At least, I think that is where I read about that glass-breaking description.  I just had a look at the summary on Wikipedia, and the glass-breaking incident was not mentioned.  Hopefully some of your literary experts will know if this incident is, indeed, in the book, or if I have got my school novels mixed up since the 1970s.  <br/>Cheers. <br/> <br/>Doug (MEd, PhD) <br/>High School teacher (But NOT an English teacher) <br/></p>

<p class="comment">The first time I read it was as a teen and I thought right on Holden, but was a bit concerned that he was not just expressing teenage angst but something different and far more damaging. Having read it as a 50 year old, I thought oh man, this kid is seriously mentally unwell and not coping and no one in his life is seeing this.  He annoyed me mostly but I felt the underlying mental health issues ignored was the real message missed.</p>

<p class="comment">There would be a far higher percentage of violent criminals with a copy of the bible in their possession than Catcher in the Rye. There are even passages in the bible that tell us to kill! To stone people to death for working on a Sunday, to 'suffer not a witch to live' etc. There is so much violence in that book and yet conservatives would never want to ban that one. Sheer hypocrisy.</p>

<p class="comment">You say a higher percentage of people have complained about the 'f' word than anything else in the book. I've found that people who are fixated on the 'f' word have dirty minds themselves. They think of the literal meaning of the word. The 'sin' is in the mind of the beholder. I also find that some of the most conservative religious people have the dirtiest minds.</p>

<p class="comment">I'd clone Holden. He's a legend in his own lunchtime( and mine). Struck by his compassion. He may sound befuddled by life but he sees reality with a clarity. My take is that he's on a mission to save his parents. He keeps being expelled as a wake up call to them all is not well. To get off the social climbing hamster wheel and grieve the loss of their son. Salvation lies in facing the truth rather than running away from it. Pretending everything's OK when it's not is what he's on about..</p>

<p class="comment">I missed the beginning of the program. Has anyone mentioned the recent documentary and book on Salinger? I began to reread Catcher, which I hadn't read since the early 60s (by which time it must have been un-banned), laughing our loud on a Brisbane bus. But I had to stop to preserve my memories because, having seen the documentary, I now can't do anything but read it through the extraordinary sadness that pervades the film. One think I learned from the makers and commentators was that Salinger's war experience is an influence throughout his writing. He landed on DDay and fought his way through to the liberation of Paris, then was in counter-intelligence and one of the first people to enter Dachau. There's some amazing footage and a very few photographs, one of which is Salinger sitting at a makeshift table in the middle of army activities, writiing, and I think I'm right that it was Catcher that he worked on and that kept him relatively sane, throughout the war - though he did indeed have a breakdown after more than 200 straight days of combat. <br/>Thanks for the program. Do see this amazing story on film. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">It's interesting, the generation gap in response to this book. The generation of the 60's, the baby boomers connect with Holden absolutely but the new generation, Gen Y, think that Holden is superficial. When my son was prescribed this book for his school reading I was quite excited because of the way the book spoke to me in my youth: as your guest says, he absolutely nailed it! How I was shocked, when after my son had read it and I optimistically asked his opinion, didn't like it and turned round and commented that the only phoney in the bok was Holden himself.</p>

<p class="comment">Your listener who had 'Catcher' confiscated by Australian Customs reminds me of the time my Henry Miller collection was similarly seized at Sydney Wooloomooloo docks in 1966 arriving from the USA. Miller was a friend of mine and had autographed the 3 books. I asked the officer what happens to them and his cocky reply was 'We read them and then they get burned'. <br/>Exactly 1 month to the day I received a letter from Customs informing me that I had exactly 1 month to appeal the decision or they'd be destroyed. That month expired on the very day of destruction. A cruel joke played out rather than bureaucratic idiocy. From that day on I've always been opposed to any form of censorship of literature or of anything for that matter!<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">Stellar was very eloquent for year 9 but not quiet so much as Mary, Bob or Michael; but her comments were so heartfelt and penetrating and I longed to hear more from her.  The other’s comments were wonderful really but in comparison they somehow did feel a little bit “phoney”.  On first reading the book after long hearing it mentioned by many, I was disappointed; and like Stellar I do not like Holden.  It reminded me too much of empty, apathetic, wasted years of high school where I learnt and did so little.   After high school I was lucky to stumble on the joy and fulfilment of a full engagement with life and people but there was no prospect of that kind of growth in Holden that I could see. <br/>The book does reflect well the disaster that our high school system is for the creativity and inspiration of so many.   I think the problem with Holden is not that he is lazy, as Stellar put it, but that he has been poorly nurtured to be the engaged, joyfully thriving teenager that is all our birth potential; by family, community and probably as much as any by high school.   This is what I would have loved to hear Stellar comment on:  does she see peers going through the same; for those that aren’t  is it due to better nurture along the way or a better high school structure perhaps?   Big questions for one so young perhaps but this is perhaps the utility, I am now beginning to think, the book, and such discussion could promote.  Catcher in the Rye reminds me of the ennui of Tolstoys early writings in “Childhood and Youth”;   He followed that with the brilliantly inspiring and life affirming  characters of “War and Peace” and Levin and Kitty and others in “Anna Karenina”.  It’s a great pity that Salinger has not done something similar.<br/></p>

A book is vehicle that creates a kind of induced empathy to display some kind of meaning or narrative-it cannot stay between the flags as by definition we are all swimming existentially at a different  part of the 'beach'. To me Holden is wonderfully portrayed as a real person with pluses and minuses, imperfect but struggling with unacknowledged  grief in a society which hides from emotion because it can be difficult. At times Holden avoids interaction as we all do  because it takes effort and is unpredictable but ultimately we learn that everything that with meaning involves emotion and therefore people</p>

<p class="comment">I was an exchange student in the mid 1960s in a small US town and The Catcher wasn't banned exactly, but the teachers strongly disapproved.  The librarian said, "There is no reason for that book ever to have been written".  So a copy was of course circulated among the students.  I found Holden boring; he reminded me of Hamlet without the drama.  I re-read it recently and picked up on many details that escaped me the first time around, but I still found him boring.  However, I can now admire Salinger's skill.</p>

<p class="comment">While most of the comments above are about the book, I'd like to comment on the program. Always a fan of Michael Cathcart, he went up again in my estimation with his gentle and encouraging treatment of the young student who was a bit tongue-tied due to stage-fright.</p>

<p class="comment">Another view and suggestion.<br/>I regret missing the opportunity to help select the “top 10 American classics” however, may I suggest that “The Jungle” by Upton Sinclair would be a worthy consideration for some discussion in Friday books and art.<br/>The novel was and still is controversial as it was written by (that dirty word) a socialist.  As outlined in the following quotation from Wiki, it precipitated legislation that eventually created the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br/>While the USA is “the land of opportunity” and a magnet attracting immigrants from third world countries it can still all these years after “The Jungle” be a place of desperate poverty for the unsuccessful in their society.  A book definitely worth some discussion.<br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle#Federal_response<br/><br/>President Theodore Roosevelt had described Sinclair as a "crackpot" because of his socialist positions.[10] … After reading The Jungle, Roosevelt agreed with some of Sinclair's conclusions. Roosevelt wrote, "radical action must be taken to do away with the efforts of arrogant and selfish greed on the part of the capitalist."[12] He assigned the Labor Commissioner Charles P. Neill and social worker James Bronson Reynolds to go to Chicago to investigate some meat packing facilities.<br/><br/>Learning about the visit, owners had their workers thoroughly clean the factories prior to the inspection, but Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions. Their oral report to Roosevelt supported much of what Sinclair portrayed in the novel, excepting the claim of workers falling into rendering vats.[13] Neill testified before Congress that the men had reported only "such things as showed the necessity for legislation."[14] That year, the Bureau of Animal Industry issued a report rejecting Sinclair's most severe allegations, characterizing them as "intentionally misleading and false," "willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact," and "utter absurdity."[15]<br/><br/>Roosevelt did not release the Neill-Reynolds Report for publication. His administration submitted it directly to Congress on June 4, 1906.[16] Public pressure led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906; the latter established the Bureau of Chemistry (in 1930 renamed as the Food and Drug Administration.<br/>(more) Continued interest<br/>The book has been in print since 1906 and is considered a classic of American protest literature.<br/>	End of quote<br/> <br/></p>

<p class="comment">I think anyone with a pinch of white middle class guilt within themselves, could perhaps dislike Holden Caulfield or the book. This would be a short change deal to make with yourself tho! (Also just because its a classic with many credible stamps of approval, doesn't mean we all have to love it!) <br/>If I were to stop at Holden's attitudes to girls and women,  sure, I might be offended, from my 21st century politically correct position. BUT! He is a teenage guy in the 1940's/50's! <br/>I find it objectionable  that some readers have diagnosed Holden as having serious mental health problems/ illness. At times  I was certainly worried about him. However, the more I read and learn from him, the more I feel that he was a young guy grappling with death/grief /trauma without much input or support from his family.  <br/>The spectrum &amp; clarity of Holden's thoughts are so real to me. Hilarious, insightful, flippant, rude, critical, cynical, teenage, wise, sad, deeply empathetic. To me this character expresses a pre-adult-like humanism &amp; idealism that strikes a cord for us adults who have lost the plot, really. Who wants to be the arsehole to say "There's  no career path in being a Catcher in the Rye" ? <br/>Here I am reminded of an exchange I had with a work colleague many years ago. I was upset by a clever magazine advertisement campaign, the spread was called "Suit-a-cide" , promoting well tailored mens suits.  The images were of glamorous guys stepping off buildings &amp; out of windows.  I was outraged and upset, whist my colleague's response was <br/>" Oh ha, let the Suits jump out the  window if that's what they want to do!  " <br/>I just felt that anecdote relayed very different attitudes to life; our own life and towards those around us.<br/>I feel fortunate to have met Holden ( who may be unrealistically  infused with the reflections &amp; experiences of an adult author) thanks for that JD Salinger! <br/></p>
