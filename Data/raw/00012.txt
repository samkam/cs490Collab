<h1><a href="../index.html">Tale of Two Cities</a></h1><h2><a href="index.html">Book 1 - Recalled To Life</a></h2><h2><a href="../../">Charles Dickens</a></h2><h3>Chapter 1 - The Period</h3>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p>
<p>IT WAS the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the
age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of
belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the
winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing
before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
direct the other way- in short, the period was so far like the present
period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being
received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
comparison only.
<p>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on
the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a
queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries
it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of
loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.
<p>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that
favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained
her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private
in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing
that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen
of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this
very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped
out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately
come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British
subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more
important to the human race than any communications yet received
through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
<p>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness
down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of
her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such
humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off,
his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because
he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession
of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty
or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of
France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was
put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be
sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack
and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in
the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to
Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude
carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and
roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set
apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and
that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently and no one
heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather,
forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to
be atheistical and traitorous.
<p>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without
removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the
highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being
recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in
his character of "the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head
and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard
shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in
consequence of the failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail
was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of
London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one
highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his
retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their
turkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them,
loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond
crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms;
musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods,
and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fir on the
mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the
common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever
worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up
long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy
of sixpence.
<p>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and
close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer
worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of
the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their
divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of
small creatures- the creatures of this chronicle among the rest- along
the roads that lay before them.
