<p>While we have an <a href="http://screenrant.com/inception-movie-reviews-vic-68744/"><strong><em>Inception</em></strong> review</a> where you can leave comments, weâve set up this page as a place where you can discuss the <strong><em>Inception</em></strong> ending and other spoilers without worrying about ruining the movie for folks who havenât seen it yet.</p>
<p>To help steer discussion weâve added a lengthy analysis of <em>Inception </em>(especially the ending) and explained why our analysis of the film fits with the story Christopher Nolan intended to tell.</p>
<p>Does our <em>Inception</em> explanation match your theory? Find out!</p>

<p>Many people walked away from <em>Inception</em> impressed. Some were confused, some were even feeling like they had their brains woken by the most exciting and thought-provoking movie experience to come along all year.</p>
<p>I realize that most people who saw <em>Inception</em> have already made up their minds about what they perceived the film to be (and Nolan will undoubtedly be proud of that). However, for those of you still looking for an <em>Inception</em> explanation, we like to offer a few thoughts.</p>
<p>Weâve organized things by category for you, in case youâre more interested in one facet of the film than another. If you want to read about specific points you can follow the links below:</p>

<h3>The Rules</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Inception production still 4 Inception Ending Explained" class="aligncenter" height="380" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-production-still-4.jpg" title="Inception production  still 4" width="570"/></p>
<p>So, the first thing to talk about are the rules of the dream world Nolan created for the film. With all the action that happened onscreen, it was easy to forget some of the finer details â but once the lights came up, and people had time to think, I know the question of who was dreaming which dreams certainly came up (among others questions as well).</p>
<p>Remember the basic premise: Cobb (the extractor) and his team are con artists, and like any con artists their job is to construct a false reality and manipulate it in order to confuse and/or fool a mark (in this case industrialist Robert Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy). Nolan takes the classic concept of a con man a step further by making Cobb and his team dream thieves, but in the end, the basic concept is still your classic con/heist movie.</p>
<p><strong>Dream Levels and Dream Time</strong></p>
<p>Nolan throws a lot of fancy math at you but itâs all really inconsequential. All you need to really know are the basic concepts:</p>
<p>The dream within a dream process puts you into a deeper state of dreaming. The deeper you go, the further removed your mind is from reality. We all know what thatâs like: the deeper you sleep, the harder it is to be woken up and the more vivid and real-feeling a dream becomes. If youâre in a deep enough sleep, not even the usual physical ques to wake up effect you, such as the sensation of falling (âthe kickâ) or even, say, having to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Inception production still 3 Inception Ending Explained" class="aligncenter" height="380" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-production-still-3.jpg" title="Inception   production still 3" width="570"/></p>
<p>By the time you reach the Limbo state it can be so difficult to wake, and the dream can feel so vividly real, that the mind stops trying to wake at all â the mind accepts the dream as its reality, like slipping into a coma.</p>
<p>When you wake up in Limbo you donât remember that there is such a thing as a âreal worldâ â as in any dream, you wake up in the middle ofÂ  a scene and simply accept it for what it is. Breaking yourself out of this cycle is extremely difficult, which is why Cobb and his wife Mal were trapped in Limbo for what seemed like decades.</p>
<p>Time is the other factor. The deeper you go into a dream state, the faster your mind is able to imagine and perceive things within that dream state. Weâre told the increase is exponential, so going deeper into dreams turns minutes into hours, into days, into years. This is why Cobb and his team are able to pull off the Fischer job while the van is still falling through the air, before the soldiers break into the snow fortress, before Arthur rigs the elevator, and all within the span of a flight from Sydney Australia to LA.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Inception DiCaprio Murphy on plane Inception Ending Explained" class="aligncenter" height="367" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-DiCaprio-Murphy-on-plane.jpg" title="Inception  DiCaprio Murphy on plane" width="551"/></p>
<p>In Limbo, the mind works so fast that actual minutes can be interpreted as years gone by. When Saito âdiesâ from the gunshot wound he received on level 1 of the dream, his mind falls into Limbo, and Saito remains there for the minutes it takes Cobb and Ariadne (Ellen Page) to follow him into Limbo â those minutes in one dream state feel like decades to Saito in his Limbo state.Â  By the time Cobb deals with expelling Malâs âshadowâ from his subconscious, Saito has begun to perceive himself as an old man.</p>
<p>Malâs shadow stabs Cobb during the filmâs climax, which throws Cobb back out into Limbo and onto the shores of Saitoâs limbo house. When Cobb has to âwakeâ again in Limbo, his mind is muddled just like old man Saitoâs brain. Through Saitoâs memory of Cobbâs totem and some shared dialogue that included key trigger phrases â âLeap of faith,â âOld man full of regret, waiting to die alone,â etc. â Cobb and Saito are able to remember the meaningful conversations they had and that there is a reality they existed in before Limbo, where both of them had deep desires still waiting to be fulfilled (Cobb and his kids, Saito and his business). Once they remember that limbo is limbo,Â  they are able to wake themselves up (likely with a gunshot to the head).</p>

<p>I think heâs still dreaming; think about it, Nolan made it a big deal to tell us, that no one is allowed to touch each others totem..well when Cobb goes into limbo to find saito, he is brought Iân by guards, and they tell saito he was found with this, and this; and they laid out a pistol and cobbâs totem saito picked it up, which if the whole thing is true, he would of ruined itâs purpose. Iâve watched this movie seventeen times Iân one month to figure this out, nolan did a great job with this project and it had inspire me to write countless screenplays myself, just think about it, cause if all I said is trueâ¦then he is still dreaming!! Please get back to me I love discussing movies specially this one!</p>

<p>What you have missed in the Rule of the Totem, though, is that you donât share your totem with anybody in the real world. In a dream it doesnât matter, because the totem owner is still the only person to know the actual weight and feel of the totem (and how it acts in the real world), so it is okay to share a totem if you are positive that you are in a dream. The other dreamers do not necessarily know that this is your totem or how it actually acts/feels/looks/etc. in the real world</p>

<p>noooo â see your getting it all wrong. The purpose of not letting someone touch your totem is because if they see every detail of it, they can trick you &amp; you wont be able to know whats a dream or not</p>

<p>Well, if they donât know that itâs your totem, then they wouldnât know to manipulate it to trick you.  If they think itâs just a random object in you, then itâs useless to them.  Also, they JUST found him, and brought him to Saito (donât know how to spell his name) right away so they wouldnât have had time to change the top.</p>

<p>The totem has itâs alternate effect in the dream world, controlled by the architect.  If the top were spun in the dream world it would be the architectâs perception of physics that would determine if it spun continuously or fell.  </p>
<p>We do, however, see a couple of guns âthoughtâ into the dream world by mere participants in the scene before the van is about to leave the warehouse. This implies the participants have a certain level of control within the dream.  If this were true the top would spin if the spinner wanted it to, and could also fall if they wanted it to, thereby destroying the absolute notion of true reality.</p>
<p>We donât know if Dicaprio remembers how he got to the original interaction with Saito at the start of the movie; He does perceive memories but none are shown regarding recent events leading to that moment, nor could any be shown without documenting his entire life.  Therefore, any events we consider ties to reality could all have been part of a dream world from the start.</p>
<p>I personally donât see any way of knowing what is real and what isnât.  All of the characters could be projections in Dicaprioâs own mind.  He states early on that he is the best extractor in the world and later implies that he is the only one that has achieved inception.  How could he definitively know this?  Perhaps it is a merely a brag session, perhaps there is some evidence, or perhaps it all happens in his own mind.  It is a bit far fetched to think he would be exiled from the US and blamed for his wifeâs death when Iâm sure the investigators would be able to determine that she plummeted from a different building than the one he was standing in.  And her cleared psych evaluations used to confirm her claims of him being a danger to the children would be discarded when they determined she had committed suicide.</p>
<p>But again, its a movie and we donât know everything about the world contained within it, so there are no real cues to follow to make a determination of his reality.</p>
<p>He also could be in a massive delusion for whatever reason and we are simply never subjected to the stimili outside of his own mind.  Maybe he doesnât have kids, maybe he never had a wife, maybe heâs a fat guy in a straight jacket (think Identity).</p>
<p>Look at it how you want and maybe learn a little about yourself <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> </p>

<p>Happily, I did not get dizzy from watching this film as I expected from South Parkâs Insheeption spoof of the film â all I came away with is how unpleasant Leonardo Di Caprio is â his face is not worth the screen time but he does resemble the Japanese guy sitting across the airplane aisle form him.  And Neither of them resemble consistently cute Joseph Gordon Levitt or Ellen Page. </p>
<p>I didnât get hung up about the dream within a dream quandary at all.  I am totatlly fed up with the lead actor however.  SO unpleasant.</p>

<p>In reply to Archaeon:</p>
<p>âI know how English grammar works. I TEACH it.â</p>
<p>I also teach grammar.  The difference between you and me is that I actually know what I am talking about.</p>
<p>In the sentence âThere are a lot of people hereâ, âa lot ofâ is an idiomatic expression.  It means âa large number ofâ or âmanyâ.  There is also the literal meaning of âa lot ofâ as in âHe owns a lot of landâ.  The expression could also be used with uncountable nouns to mean âa large amountâ as in âThere is a lot of sandâ.  âPeopleâ and âtheoriesâ are counatble nouns however so âThere is a lot of peopleâ is obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Look, you donât believe me?  Fine.  Check out âEssential Grammar in Use Second Editionâ (Cambridge University Press 1990, 1997) by Raymond Murphy, page 172.  It gives the example âThere ARE a lot of trees/shops/peopleâ¦(plural verb)â.  The emphasis is theirs.  Are you going to argue now with Cambridge University about what is correct grammar.  Seriously?</p>
<p>Similarly, âa ton of theoriesâ as in âThere are a ton of theoriesâ does not literally mean âtheories measured out to weigh one tonâ.  âa ton ofâ is not seriously meant as a measure but as an idiomatic expression meaning, in this case, âa large numberâ.  The verb-subject agreement is with the nound theories which is clearly plural.  It would be as if you said âThere are a million theories.â</p>

<p>I hope youâre more polite and respectful in your classes than you were at the beginning of the above response.</p>
<p>I, too, know my subject matter and my chosen profession, but I am always willing to review what Iâve said and the particulars of a given conversation. In this case, I went back and looked at the original statement, the one that started this whole pointless mess. I also looked at various classroom materials and online sources.</p>
<p>One thing I realized (and it amazes me that I had let this detail slip by) is that I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT. For some odd reason, I thought I had, but I had only gone as far back as Arturoâs initial correction. Thus, I must, in fairness, admit that the original usage might indeed lend credence to your perspective.</p>
<p>This is not to say that my perspective is wrong, however. I DID find several sources that proved your point, admittedly. I did, ALSO, find a few that gave weight to my argument, as well. My mistake was in being too general in my definition of what was being described and expressed. The formality/informality of the original statement, its referent(s), and the point made by the original author (and, thus, his surrounding/leading statements) influenced the form his sentence took. I should have considered these things instead of simply glomming on to Arturoâs comment. For THAT (and ONLY that), I do apologize.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I stand by what I saidâ¦with the addendum that it is not an absolute.</p>
<p>Now, can we PLEASE drop what has become a truly pointless off-topic conversation and get back to âInceptionâ?</p>

<p>In the future you might want to try being a little less arrogant, especially when you obviously havenât bothered to check any references to see if what you are saying is actually true and not just complete nonsense.</p>

<p>THAT is the statement to which I was responding. THAT is the very definition of arrogance.</p>
<p>I realized a mistake I had made, in terms of my initial observation, NOT my conclusion. I attempted to correct my mistake (or, at least, to explain it). I even tried, honestly and fairly, to point out that we both had made valid points. I did not speak down to you in MY response. I pity your students if thatâs how you behave in class.

<p>â¦.did you not forget the concept that he may still be dreaming, from after when he goes to trial test out the asians guys own compoundâ¦after he wakes we see a shot of him in the bathroom watching his totem spin, but someone interupts him and he knocks it over himselfâ¦..so we never know whether it was going to still spin or not??!!â¦..</p>

</div>
<p>As much as I respect the well planned layout of this site, I have problems with your arguments.</p>
<p>1. Was Saito truly powerful enough to make one phone call and end Cobbâs problems or was that just Cobb in limbo projecting his subconscious wish to go home? You can argue logistics all you want, but if itâs said that Saito is a powerful and wealthy man (he bought a whole airline on a whim), then thereâs reason enough to infer that he could bend the legal system for Cobb. Rich powerful people bend laws all the time.</p>
<p>You assume Saito isnât a projection. Iâm arguing from the perspective that his wife was indeed correct in believing that the âreal worldâ Leonardo came back into was still a dream. </p>
<p>Did Cobbâs father (Michael Caine) arrange to meet him at the airport or is he there because heâs Cobbâs projection? At this point weâre reading way too much into things. There is a phone on the plane, so Cobb couldâve easily arranged for pickup. This was also an intricate plan they were hatching, so arranging for airport pickup would probably be on the to-do list.</p>
<p>But yet one point remains clear and is repeated. One shot shows Cobb seeing his father at the airport, the next shows him at home with his father. Itâs reading too much into it to assume that Cobb knew how he actually got home.</p>
<p>In early dream scenes Cobb is wearing a wedding band that doesnât appear in the âreal worldâ scenes or the end scenes in the airport â does that mean the ending is âreality?â Details like that are certainly strong evidence that there is a real world and that Cobb does live in it at times â such as when he isnât wearing a wedding band.</p>
<p>In a dream, one can manipulate objects at will sometimes. If he is indeed convinced that his âreal worldâ is real, then he would perceive himself without the ring. Quite simple really.</p>
<p>Does the fact that Cobb uses Malâs totem mean it doesnât work as a totem and therefore he never knows if heâs in reality or not? Again, weâre reading a little too deep into things. The only people who know the weight and feel of that totem are Mal and Cobb, and since Mal is dead, Cobb is the only one left who knows the totemâs tactile details. So yes, he could certainly use it as a measure of reality, the totem was not âruinedâ by him using it.</p>
<p>This also goes along with the wedding ring. He can manipulate the object all he wants. What gives that certain object any special ability over any cup or bowl in his dream? Especially if heâs the architect.</p>
<p>At the end, Cobbâs kids seem to be the same age and are seemingly wearing the same clothes as they were in his memory of them â is it âproofâ heâs still dreaming? As carefully documented by our own Vic Holtreman, at the end of the film Cobbâs kids are wearing similar outfits to the ones he remembers, but their shoes are different. As for their ages: if you check IMDB, there are actually two set of actors credited with playing Cobbâs kids. The daughter, Phillipa, is credited as being both 3 and 5 years old, while the son, James, is credited as being both 20 months and 3 years old. This suggests that while it might be subtle, there is a difference between the kids in Cobbâs memories and the kids Cobb comes home to. That would suggest the homecoming is in fact âreality.â But feel free to debate that.</p>
<p>He can also manipulate what his kids look like based upon his own belief in the dream. What is clear, though, is that the human mind isnât truly revolutionary in creating itâs own ideas. It draws off previous or existing details. So he alters the shoes and ages, big deal. What is striking ARE the similarities. </p>
<p>Will the spinning top keep spinning or was it about to fall over just before Nolan cut to black? </p>
<p>Again, what does it matter if heâs the architect and created every item in the dream. He can manipulate it all.</p>

<p>She ultimately understood that Cobb found her top in Limbo and altered the idea. She could not break free, and had to take a Leap of Faith when waiting for the train. And once free..the idea was stuck. And that is what an Inception does. It sticks in reality, and no matter how many times she would reality check herself it would not matter since her secret of the totem was no longer a secret. Cobb knew this too and he did not have the heart to tell her. He only tells himself and Ariadne in the end when he comes clean about it.</p>

</div>
<p>@Tyken, at what point did she âultimately understand that Cobb altered her top in limboâ?</p>
<p>In response to @dan, I think we must assume she did spin it.  Whether Cobb ever tried it himself would be another question.</p>
<p>But what happens when she spins it?  If it falls, Mal would just look for other excuses to support her deeply âinceptedâ beliefs.  She even says to Cobb that their current world seems real to him, only because he believes it to be real, she probably thinks his beliefs are overriding hers, here, in what she still believes to be limbo, or perhaps a dream level.  (Again, the confusion concerning even this small detail is intentional, allowing the film to maintain its ambiguity.  Where did Mal think she was?!)</p>
<p>On the otherhand, it the top did keep on spinningâ¦ well, iâll let you come to your own conclusions.  But if it did, imo, it probably fell over the second Cobb ever entered the same room where she was spinning it.</p>

<p>She always knew, I mean..who else could have found out her secret but Cobb? But she still had to take a leap of faith when they escaped on the tracks. And she gave him the same ultimatum when she escaped after coming back to reality.. sadly.</p>

<p>She didnât even find the totem spinning. Once Cobb spun it, she was already given the idea that âyour world is not realâ. It helped her escape limbo. But it did the same in reality too, which is something Cobb couldnât foresee as it was the first Inception. And a dangerous idea to plant..</p>

<p>âHappens in dreamsâ is one thing, âhappens in Dreamshareâ is quite another. And âhappening in Limbo through Dreamshareâ is a whole new playfield. Cobb and Mal were Gods in their own world. Nothing was by chance down there. Mal knew this, and made a conscious choice to forget reality while using Dreamshare. Ultimately they were both Dreamshare addicts, with sad consequences.</p>

<p>Here is another point about the dream.  When they all went under on the plane, it was raining because the one guy had to take a leak, right ? Well, when they got the kick and to wake up when the van was falling off the bridgeâ¦it was still âRAINING.â<br/>
So does that mean that they were still at that one level down in the dream after all and NOT in the real world ??</p>

</div>
<p>Of course.  The kick brought them back to the first level.  They woke up when the sedative wore off.  Likewise, Cobb and Saito were never in danger of going into a coma and not waking up: the danger was that they would not remember who they were when they woke up.  We see Saito going for a gun, presumably to shoot himself so he would wake up but it could be they woke up because the sedative had worn off.</p>
<p>Which is a good point.  Thereâs no doubt that Cobb woke up on the plane.  The real question is whether or not the entire movie was a dream.</p>

<p>The first version implyâs that the Pasiv device is the figment of a fevered dream.</p>
<p>The second, that the Pasiv device is very real and Cobb has become utterly lost within it.</p>

<p>Alrightâ¦.so I know the debate of the film is overâ¦.I just got done watching it and was wondering if anyone else had this thoughtâ¦.is it possible that the college girl, architect, was investigating Cobb?  And that the reason Cobb was sent free was because it was determined by his encounter with his wife at the end of the film that he truly did not kill his wife?  I know there arenât any direct statements within the film to prove this theory to be correct, but itâs an interesting thought that during this inception Cobb may have been under investigation for the murder of his wife <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> </p>

<p>I watched it when it first came out and was satisfied but then i kept thinking, why are the kids still wearing the same thing and in the same spot? Why are they the same age as when he left? Why donât we see the top stop spinning? So I ask is he the one that is still dreaming and his wife right and she out but heâs still in? Help me</p>

<p>Nice explanation. but the key is in Yusuf basement, when Cobb goes into sleep and dream about mal, he falls into limbo there and the rest of all movie is a Cobb dream. You can notice that when he suposly wakes up from that dream the top falls to the ground and never was tested. The only thing that changes is the way Cobb thinks about its relation with mal.</p>

<p>Just because Cobb gets distracted by his kids at the end of the movie preventing him (and the audience) from knowing whether heâs still dreaming or not doesnât mean he will never know for sure if heâs still dreaming. He can just go back to the top anytime after and see if itâs still spinning or if it stopped. Sure we as the audience will never know the truth, but let Cobb enjoy his kids whether heâs dreaming or not, all he wants is to experience happiness.</p>

<p>There was one small scene that I noticed. When Cobb is finding his team, he meets up with the gentleman (forgive me for not knowing the characters names) that has a room full of men that share dreams together. The man states that the dreams are extremely stable. Cobb has a dream about mal (his dead, crazy wife) and then wakes himself up. When he goes into the bathroom to check and see if he is still dreaming, Sato (the guy making the deal with him) interrupts him and ask him if everything is all right. Cobb picks up the totem and walks away saying yes. Could it be possible that he was sleeping for 8 hours like the rest if the men in the room and dreamt that he completes the job and went home to his kids. In addition, after that moment in the bathroom, Cobb never pulls out the totem until the endâ¦. Food for thought.</p>

<p>Nah. Cobb followed up after that with the experiments. And besides, Saito had seen the totem, âmany many years agoâ, and he did in that bathroom.</p>

<p>That doesnât really matter I think. People seem to forget that the special object only works if you are in somebody elseâs dream. Because of the whole ânot being allowed to know the weight of the objectâ.</p>
<p>Because if the dreamer knows the object then the dreamer can manipulate the object and make it do the correct actions. So if Cobb was in his own dream down in Yusufâs room, then whether or not Saito knocked it down doesnât matter because Cobb can dream the object to do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>So with that piece of information, I donât think that he is still dreaming when he spins, because that would be a major plothole, considering it doesnât even matter in his own dream.</p>

<p>The top was originally Malâs totem and he said that âMal could make the top spin and spin foreverâ and presumably he could too and that was how he convinced her that she was dreaming.  Now if they move one level up Mal should realize that they are still dreaming and try the top and presumably she did and it spun and spun and she was convinced that she was still dreaming but she couldnât convince Cobb: he was so convinced that he was in the real world that when he saw the top it would stop spinning but in the end he isnât looking at the top so it keeps spinning.  So that suggests that he had been dreaming the whole movie.  I think Terryfinnâs argument for him being in a dream world is the simplest yet, although it could also be argued that it was just something that Nolan either overlooked or didnât show: perhaps they did kill themselves a few more times to get back to reality but she was still unconvinced that her world was real.  The spinning top at the end, however, suggests that they didnât and that they were still dreaming.</p>

<p>I loved this movie. Itâs probably the best movie Iâve ever seen! They had a very unusual story line, and I liked it. I was also pulled in to how they ended up being put in a dream, then another dream, and so forth. I was intrigued by the paradoxes and impossible shapes and physics. I thought it was fascinating how the time was distorted according to dissimilar levels. They had 10 hours in reality, days in the 1st level, weeks in the 2nd level, a decade in the 3rd level, and decades in Limbo. Overall, I thought this movie was outstanding.</p>

<p>Doesnât really matter whether or not Cobb is still in Limbo or returned to the âReal Worldâ. All that really matters is that he is with his children (real or not) and is ultimately a happier person than what he was in the beginning of the movie. (even if it is just false happiness, created by his own subconsciousness)</p>
<p>My view? The ending was left to keep you guessing so I donât think there needs to be a concrete answer. (Doesnât matter how much you want one, you wonât get it. The ending is a big tease, and I like it that way)</p>

<p>Just been reading all the comments and really like all the theories. Iâm not sure what I think but is this a valid idea: what if we are always in cobbs dream and mal keeps trying to enter it to wake him? And in limbo near the end mal realises that she is loosing the battle to convince cobb that he is dreaming and decideds never to come back? Does that mean is is always in a limbo? But if he is why isnt Cobb or the chrildren getting older or is he projecting himself in that imagd? Is any of that even possible or have I missed the idea?? Iâm getting mind boggled from this film and now questioning everything about it like mal! But this is definatly reality we are inâ¦ <img alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/> </p>

<p>Well, Cobb actually reveals to Ariadne how his totems works, so the ending might aswell be Ariadnes work, the fact that Cobb and Saito dont wake up in the Van like everyone else, but they wake up straight into the plane, could be a hint that Cobb actually never reached Saito, but from the moment he was on the beach into Saitos limbo he was actually in Ariadnes dream/architecture. So that would mean that, with ariadne knowing how Cobbâs totem works, she might aswell âfoolâ him into thinking its the real world even if in reality Cobb is dreaming.</p>

<p>Everyone overlooks a few simple details:</p>
<p>The more levels deep you are, the more times you will have to kill yourself. Killing yourself within a dream within a dream will bring you back to the original dream.</p>
<p>Mal and Cobb was in Limbo, which we think is atleast four levels deep.<br/>
They were waiting for a train, and when the train hit them, they wake up.</p>
<p>Wait, donât they have to kill themselves three more times after waking up from Limbo?</p>

<p>Arthur was not under a powerful sedative during the first mission on Saito, thats why he woke up one level above. If you ask me, perhaps the levels above Cobb and Mal in Limbo had collapsed because they died in the dreamlevels while influenced by a powerful sedative, and thats how they ended up in Limbo in the first place. When Cobb and Saito escapes Limbo in the end, the levels above them are gone.</p>

<p>It wasnât made clear due to the frantic pace of the action (and hence little time for exposition) but I take it that Cobb and Saito woke up when the sedative wore off.  Cobb had to find Saito and remind him that his world was not real so that he would remember who he was when he woke up and be able to make the phone call that would enable Cobb to see his family.</p>
<p>That brings up another point though.  If Cobb and Mal were in Limbo for 50 years then didnât their sedative wear off?  And if it didnât wear off because they had taken too much then would killing themselves in the dream work?  Some people say that Cobb and Saito shot themselves and woke up but that should only work if the sedative had worn off.  So if the sedative has worn off then killing yourself in the dream wakes up but if the sedative has not worn off then killing yourself in the dream wonât work.</p>
<p>So what does that mean with Arthur in the opening scene?  He âdiesâ in the dream but he only goes up one level.  Oh, I see, it is because the architect was still dreaming and Arthur was in his dream and Arthur could not wake up until his dream was over, not unless he died again with the sedative having worn off.  Saito and Cobb could wake up because the Ames, Arthur and the chemist had already woken up: as you say âthe dreams had collapsedâ because the dreamers had woken up.</p>
<p>But then that brings up another question!  Who went to sleep with Mal and Cobb that they were able to get to Limbo and stay there for 50 years?  That was never explained.  For the job, they needed at least three people, one person dreaming each level.  I donât see how Cobb and Mal reached Limbo by working alone.  That was never explained.  Could they take turns, with Cobb dreaming the first level and Mal dreaming the second level, etc.?  But then the levels above them havenât collapsed because they are the ones dreaming those levels.  Oops.</p>

<p>They were on a powerful sedative, went into the first level and died. Then woke up to a new reality, called Limbo.</p>
<p>Arthur however was not on a powerful sedative, so he woke up the level above as usual.</p>

<p>We can only assume they died to get to limbo, just as we can only assume that there are only 4 levels of dreamshare.  The lack of specifics serves the ambiguity, hence the lack of specifics.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the limbo is not a higher level of dreamstate, rather it is an âunconstructedâ dreamstate as mentioned in the film. Therefore you can fall into a limbo without having constructed multiple dream layers. You can just construct a single dream layer then kill yourself to fall into an unconstructed limbo(on the supposition that you are under a strong enough sedation). And thats how cobb and mal were able to fall into a limbo without extra personel. They took a strong sedative that would stop them from waking up before it would ware off and killed themselves at the first level of dreamstate, thus falling into an unconstructed limbo where mal refused to wake up(kill her self) even after the sedation would have worn off because she accepted the limbo as reality( losing her mind, like when Adrine tells Cobb after he decides to stay in the limbo to find saito âdont lose your mindâ). Cobb then had to convince her that they were in a limbo and they killed themselves waking up after spending a lifetime in the limbo.</p>

<p>But Cobb did speak from experience. I dont think they went in only one level before they ended up in limbo. I believe Cobb and Mal experimented with âGreat depthâ but ultimately lots of stuff went wrong..and âyearsâ went by playing God in Limbo after one of them died and one perhaps followed. The scene at the anniversary..could that be when? There is so much that is unsaid in Inception, which we can only imagine. Why did Mal want to stay in Limbo and not wake up? At one time they both understood Limbo, but Mal chose to stay there. She fooled herself with her own totem, placing it toppled, in âreality modeâ in her own safe. She did this on purpose to herself.. yet another experiment that went wrong.</p>

<p>Yes you are right Cobb did say that he and mal experimented with dream stages. And IMO, based strictly on my assumption, during those experiments,possibly with other people and sometimes Cobb staying on one level and Mal going into another, they may have stumbled upon the existence of the Limbo. Then they both decided to go into limbo together via the method I have suggested above without the help of others. And they did spend years playing God in the limbo during which Mal âlost her mindâ ( the attraction of the limbo was too great, similar to why Ariadne came back to cobbâs workshop)and decided to lockaway her symbol of reality into her subconscious SAFE, losing her sense of whats real and what isnt completely. Cobb who was still aware, used inception ( breaking into her subconscious safe and spinning her totem) to plant the idea in Malâs mind that the limbo is a dream. And they both killed themselves together by going under the train. After they came back to reality, the idea that Cobb had put into Malâs subconscious kept own growing like a virus and eventually Mal started to doubt the world in which they were in and was convinced that she was still dreaming and tried to persuade Cobb as well. Cobb refused and so Mal devised a plan to commit suicide on their wedding aniversary telling the authorities false lies about Cobb, putting him in danger so that he will commit suicide with her. Mal died and Cobb became a fugitive.</p>

<p>Well put. And yea, Nolan is a true genius alright. Truly open film. I sometimes watch the anniversary scene as something that may have happened in one of the dreamlevels they experimented with. Mal tried to convince Cobb they were still stuck after escaping Limbo. And she took her leap of faith and woke up, but Cobb was the one that stayed behind and forever after lost in a loop, and projects everyone and everything around him, figments of his own personality to guide him out. Ariadne was clearly a female version of Cobb in a way. She kept âpushing and pushingâ, wanted Cobb to go deeper, further. </p>
<p>I think you might like this. The whole Jungian aspect is mindblowing to read.</p>

<p>Okay, I see where you are going with this.  So they kill themselves in their dream to wake up but because they have taken a strong sedative they donât wake up but go into Limbo.  They need to spend years in Limbo because it was a strong sedative and they will need to have a few hours pass in the real world if the sedative is to wear off.  They kill themselves again and Cobb believes he is back in the real world but Mal is not sure: she kills herself but she is unable to convince Cobb to kill himself.  So is Cobb still dreaming or not?  I think they were still dreaming because I donât think the dream above them had collapsed.  That makes a big difference: Arthur died in a dream but he didnât wake up, he just went up one level.  Cobb and Saito may have woken up from Limbo but Cobb that is irrelevant because Cobb is still dreaming.  We didnât actually see Cobb and Saito shoot each other: the fact that they realized they were in a dream, with the sedative having worn off, may have been enough to cause them to wake up.</p>

<p>During the Saito mission, Arthur was killed in level 2 and woke up in level 1. Same with Saito, who thought he was waking up in his own apartment in reality. Cobb was woken up with a kick since the slap he got from Nash didnt do anything.(See? very stable.) Normal procedure for Dreamshare to wake up when you die. But the thing with the mission was something new, something even the great Saito didnt know: They were 2 levels down, and the same rules still applied. If Arthur had been killed in level 1 = hed woken up on the train in reality.</p>

<p>As we all seem to be assuming out of context here ( very interestingly so), I think if mal did wake up instead of falling to her death, sheâd surely have tried to wake up Cobb by giving him the âkickâ which is quicker and more effective than coming back to his subconscious and persuading him to kill hisself. And so the fact that we dont see cobb being given the kick( apart from the ones involved in the âjobâ)  I would say that argument is a lil farfetched..nonetheless very imaginative and engaging.</p>

<p>Thatâs why i value the ambiguity surrounding the possibilty that the pair of them reached limbo, not through a first-level-death, but through a much deeper-level-death.  Which, of course, is to indulge the assumption that more than 4 dream levels are a possibility.  But if anyone can give me something solid to disprove the idea, iâd be happy to close the book on it.</p>

<p>The significance of which, I should add, is the extended time ratio which multiple levels would provide.  The time it takes for Mal to stand up and give him the âkickâ could be a year for Cobb. </p>
<p>Also, the limbo to reality time ratio is never given to us explicitly.  And for that matter, if you go to limbo from level 1, is your time ratio to reality the same as if you go to limbo from level 4, or howâs that work.  Does limbo have a time ratio constant?</p>

<p>The movie seemed to establish, though, that a different dreamer in the same Dreamshare was needed for each level. With only Cobb and Mal, they shouldnât have been able to go more than two levels down, and then one of them would already have been left out. For the type of timescale difference youâre suggesting between Cobb and a woken up Mal, they would have had to have been many more levels down, and they would have needed a few more dreamers.</p>

<p>Not necessarily, the movie only establishes the guidelines like that because it is essential for the team to have a strategy for kicking themselves back to reality, hence the different dreamers in each level.</p>
<p>I posit that taking turns between 2 people could have worked.  After all, the Pasiv device is new technology, and even Cobb still experiments with it, and he is considered an expert to some degree, so surely we canât be sure of anything that isnât otherwise stated in the film.</p>

<p>Agreed. Whoâs to say they couldnât take turns? After all they were experimenting, going deeper and deeper, further. Downwards is the only way forwards..</p>

<p>BTW, on a strong sedative (1:20) one need only be 4 levels deep to turn 2 seconds into 370 days.  I can show you the math if you like.</p>

<p>But the problem is if you wake/kick up someone from Limbo, they will be in a state of coma. It was important for teh subject to truly KNOW that Limbo wasnt real before leaving.</p>
<p>But Mal was not sure when she left with Cobb. Mal loved Cobb too much, and wanted to leave with him on the traintracks without question. But when Mal was leaving Cobb, he could not. He was always so sure what was real or not..<br/>
But Mal was the complex one, who really knew the absolute:</p>
<p>They could be 100% certain, that they could never be sure.</p>
<p>And the Inception sadly caused Mal to be fixxed on the idea given by Cobb: âYou world is not realâ. She got that idea in Limbo after 50 years..must have been tough to leave.</p>

<p>I forgot that thanks Ty.</p>
<p>Also, 1. Do you think it is possible for a kick to reach from reality to limbo, if the intervening dream levels have already been deconstructed.</p>
<p>and 2. If they went from the first level to limbo, what do you imagine their time ratio would be, as I was getting at?</p>

<p>Great depth was a hot topic of discussion within Inception, so I firmly believe Cobb and Mal experimented with 3+ levels. This is very important to not overlook because Cobb speaks of experience. Yusuf says at first its impossible when talking about 3 levels. Cobb says one only has to add a sedative. Yusuf corrects Cobb by adding POWERFUL sedative, to which Cobb nods without saying a word. </p>
<p>As for your questions, I dont think a kick in reality would wake up anyone from Limbo. Anyone who is in Limbo, needs to be delivered a message that its not real before they can leave, is my inkling anyway. Eames is the one who only brushes upon that if one ends in Limbo, and wakes up from it, theres a great chance youd have brains for scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>As for your second point, I see Limbo as its own level with its own time compression. One could die in level 3 and go there, or in level 1 and go there, and the time compression does not matter down there. 1 second in reality can be a year for that matter in limbo. Limbo is for me also a state of mind, outside reality. Where there are no rules, no time.</p>

<p>Yeah I think I tend to agree, Limbo would have itâs own independent time ratio, and as it is pretty much the act of one directly interfacing with their subconscious one would expect that it would be at maximum ratio, whatever that might be.</p>

<p>Please do correct me if I am wrong but didnt Ariadne wake up from a limbo(unconstructured dream she went into with cobb to find Fischer) by throwing herself off cobb/mals apartment? And she and others rode the synchronised kick to the first level to wait for the sedative to wear off? The reason why Cobb, who also (eventually)died from the Mal-inflicted stab wound in the limbo didnt wake up is because the dream right up above had collapsed â dream 3(eames) and 2(arthur)-and drowned in the first dream(yusef) hence he got lost into a further limbo, waking up on Saitoâs armed shore. The only way cobb and saito could get out of the limbo now was to wait for the sedatives to wear off and hope that the team would give them the kick as soon as they awoke. Therefore the limbo is not a coma, its merely an unconstructed dream from which you can easily awake with a kick however the problem in this case was that everyone who could give cobb/saito the kick was also still in the dream and they were all under a strong sedative set on a timer which is a loooong time for saito. And this is the reason why cobb chose to stay in the limbo to find saito; not because saito would fall into a coma and never wake up, but because saito could forget who he was and could become mentally ill when he wakes up( Like MAL). Thats why we see cobb and saito exchange a dialogue in saitoâs castle, reminding themselves of who they were(even cobb seems confused). And this is also why we see cobb and saito wake up naturally on the plane rather than through a kick, because the team couldnât know for sure if cobb had managed to remind saito of the truth, so they put away all the equipment so that fischer wouldnt get suspicious but left cobb and saito to sleep.<br/>
(THIS DOES NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT COBB ACTUALLY WOKE UP INTO REALITY. going to find saito was cobbâs plan (which ariadne knew) and how cobb imagagined he would wake up.so it could be either)</p>
<p>And Sambo, if as you say, there was another level into which cobb and mal awoke from their limbo (train track death) and that cobb is still on this dream level while mal could be a level higher or even in supposed reality, then the time difference between mal and cobb may not be years but minutes or hours because cobb will not in a limbo anymore but in one of their structured dreams, 1 or 2 levels above depending on how many they created. So if mal was to give him the kick in whichever stage that she may be, throughout the timespan of the movie( at least a few weeks) we should have seen cobb feel the kick or some even sort of a sign.</p>

<p>Yes you are right haha. Scary. But if as u say they were 5 dreams deep and the lvls above hadnât collapsed, killing yourself at level 5 as mal did by jumping from her hotel room, would only bring you to the next level up-4. So weâd have to calculate the time difference between lvl 5 and lvl4, rather than lvl 5 and reality to see when mals kick would reach cobb</p>

<p>Furthermore.. having debates over the validity of cobbâs totem and whether it was about to topple at the very end is counterproductive and will have us circling in a paradoxical loop.<br/>
1. Saitoâs handling of Cobbâs totem does not ruin its purpose, they were already in a constructed dream.<br/>
   The reason why arthur teaches ariadne to keep her totem safe from others reach is because if an architect in the real world gets hold of her totem and observes its purpose, then the architect is be able to imitate such a totem and construct it into his architecture defeating the purpose and integrity of ariadneâs totem.</p>
<p>Therefore the integrity of Cobbâs totem is protected throughout the film, the only other person who knew about the totem, mal, is dead.</p>
<p>2. The ending doesnt simply pivot around the simple notion  that if the totem spins on its a dream and if it topples its reality. We must take note of the scene where cobb tries to persuade mal of the fact that they are in reality by confronting her with his inability to control his totem. Mal argues back saying âthats because you dont know you are dreamingâ. This is a very very important factor.</p>
<p>The last dreamstate or limbo cobb puts himself into is his own. The previous dreams of eames, arthur and yusef have collapsed due to the synchronised kicks.<br/>
Lets suppose cobb was still in the limbo when he came home to his kids. From the moment cobbs wakes up on the plane he looks confused and he checks the others to see if anything is strange. He gets home and still very unsure, spins his totem but before he could see if it toppled he runs to see his kids.Now up until this very moment cobbs had restricted himself from seeing his kids faces until he was sure that they were real. But now heâs not so sure. He doenst know for a âfactâ that this is real but his wanting to âbelieveâthat its real ( malâ what do you believeâ) has carried him from the aiport to his home and to his kids. But then why does the totem seem like it is about to topple at the very last cut? Because he doesnt know for sure and/or doesnt want to believe that this is a dream. And because this is HIS dream he has control over his totem and his subconcious, his longing for his kids, may well have toppled his totem to convince himself that this is REAL.</p>
<p>So as you can see, whether the totem topples is not so much the issue because at this very last scene and at this last scene only his totem has lost its purpose. The totem could topple in both dream and reality. This film has given us a truly open ending. chris nolan is a genius.</p>

<p>Wholeheartedly agreed. The whole totem/ending discussion has so far not, and certainly will not develop into anything absolute. Unless Nolan tells about it, which he wont. Inception is as of now, Nolanâs own real life totem <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> </p>
